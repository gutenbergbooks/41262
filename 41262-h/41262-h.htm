<br />Found in the Sand</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Unless a breeze springs up soon, we&rsquo;ll be late
for the Cub Scout meeting in the Cave,&rdquo; Dan Carter
complained.</p>
<p>Sprawled in the drifting dinghy, the sandy-haired
boy raised his eyes to the limp sail which hung in
discouraged folds from the tall mast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already missed the first part of it,&rdquo; remarked
Midge Holloway.</p>
<p>A freckled youth of ten, he had draped himself
pretzel-fashion over the boat&rsquo;s bow. His skinny legs
dangled a bare inch above the placid surface of the
wide river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it anyhow?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>At the tiller of the sailboat, Midge&rsquo;s father, Burton
Holloway, snapped on his flashlight to see the
dial of his wrist watch. An official &ldquo;Den Dad&rdquo; of
Webster City Den No. 2, he frequently made river
trips with the boys and allowed them to use his
sailboat whenever they liked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>On this summer day, the three, after scrubbing
the craft&rsquo;s fouled bottom, had set forth for a brief
sail. The wind, however, had died suddenly, leaving
them stranded far from their Yacht Club moorings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ten after eight,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway answered his
son. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to work a little if we expect to get
in tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reaching for a paddle, he plied it steadily. With
snail-like speed the awkward-sized dinghy moved
toward the twinkling lights visible on shore. With
the coming of darkness, a cold, penetrating fog had
closed in over the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I&rsquo;d brought a jacket,&rdquo; Dan said with a
shiver. &ldquo;Want me to take a turn at the paddle, Mr.
Holloway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thanks, Dan, I&rsquo;m good for awhile yet. I blame
myself for being stranded out here. The wind was
dying when we left the yacht club. So I guess we
asked for trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time Mr. Holloway paddled in silence.
Now and then a big fish would leap and plop into
the water nearby. Otherwise, the river seemed unusually
quiet.</p>
<p>Then unexpectedly from the direction of Skeleton
Island came the muffled roar of a powerful motor
boat engine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>Dan twisted around to gaze upstream. He could
hear the sound of the motor plainly but the running
lights of the approaching craft were not yet
visible through the mist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that boat comes this way, we&rsquo;ll ask for a tow,&rdquo;
Mr. Holloway remarked. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re in luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Resting on the paddle for a moment, the Den Dad
allowed the dinghy to drift with the current. The
roar of the motorboat engine now had increased in
volume. Yet strangely, no one in the sailboat had
sighted the oncoming craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be running without lights?&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
remarked somewhat anxiously. &ldquo;The pilot should
know better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the mist, Dan suddenly made out the
dark, sleek outline of a speed craft which rode low
in the water. Foam boiled from her prow as she
split the waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; the boy exclaimed. &ldquo;Heading this
way, and coming fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alarmed lest the craft run down the sailboat in
the darkness, Mr. Holloway turned the beam of his
flashlight upon the limp sail overhead. To make
certain that they were seen, he flashed the light on
and off several times.</p>
<p>No answering response came from the motorboat
which drove directly toward the sailboat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t they see us?&rdquo; Mr. Holloway demanded
anxiously.</p>
<p>The motor craft now was so close that those in
the stranded sailboat caught a fleeting glimpse of
a stout man in dungarees who manned the wheel.
Of square jaw, the upper part of his face was hidden
by a billed sailor&rsquo;s cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, look out!&rdquo; Dan yelled. &ldquo;Turn on your running
lights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pilot evidently heard for he swerved the
wheel slightly. And then deliberately, as if angered
by the boy&rsquo;s remark, he spun the spokes again,
bearing directly down upon the drifting sailboat.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Mr. Holloway and the two Cubs
braced themselves for a crash.</p>
<p>The pilot of the speed boat laughed boisterously.
Having accomplished his purpose&mdash;that of frightening
the occupants of the sailing dinghy&mdash;he then
swerved away.</p>
<p>But he had misjudged the distance. As the motorboat
swung, its stern grazed the mid-section of the
sailing craft. Though the blow was a glancing one,
mahogany splintered with a grinding crash.</p>
<p>Choppy waves flung the sailboat far over on its
beam. Water began to seep in through a break in
the over-lap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>Instead of throttling down, the motorboat sped
away into the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that dirty crook!&rdquo; Midge exclaimed furiously.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s wrecked our boat, and he doesn&rsquo;t even
intend to stop! Hey, you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man at the wheel turned slightly. In the
moment before he raised his hand to cover the
exposed lower part of his face, Dan obtained a fleeting
but clear view of him. Two others in the boat
crouched low and kept their backs turned.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway leaped to his feet in the teetering
sailboat. Flashing his light on the disappearing
craft, he tried to discern the license number. None
was visible.</p>
<p>Despite the shouts of Mr. Holloway and the
Cubs, the boat did not slacken speed. Soon it was
nearly out of sight, still running without lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men should be arrested!&rdquo; Midge declared.
&ldquo;They struck us on purpose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan had noticed that his feet were resting in an
inch of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;ve sprung a leak!&rdquo; he cried, scrambling
for a bailing can which was kept under the seat.
&ldquo;Now we are in a jam!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>The latest emergency caused Mr. Holloway to
divert his attention from the motorboat. Anxiously,
he examined the jagged hole in the mahogany over-lap
through which a trickle of water oozed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midge, give me that rag under the seat!&rdquo; he
directed.</p>
<p>As his son handed it over, Mr. Holloway wedged
it as tightly as he could into the larger hole, pressing
it in with his knife blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That should help some, but we&rsquo;re still shipping
water,&rdquo; he said anxiously. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to bail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already Dan was at work dipping with the tin
can which was kept for just such an emergency.
While Mr. Holloway paddled hard for shore, he
and Midge took turns dipping water from the bottom
of the boat. By working steadily, they could
keep ahead of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d certainly like to know who those men were
that struck us,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway remarked. &ldquo;Aside
from the damage they&rsquo;ve done to our boat, they&rsquo;re
a menace on the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, didn&rsquo;t you think the boat looked a little like
Jonathan Manheim&rsquo;s?&rdquo; Midge inquired. &ldquo;It was built
on the same general lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did notice a resemblance,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway replied.
&ldquo;But I never before saw the man at the wheel.
I&rsquo;d hate to think it was Manheim&rsquo;s boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>Fairly well known to the Cubs, Mr. Manheim was
the owner of Skeleton Island and a prominent member
of the Webster City Yacht Club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he would try to run us down deliberately?&rdquo;
Dan asked, working steadily with the
bailing can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem so to me, Dan. It&rsquo;s possible that
someone else borrowed his boat. However, since we
failed to get the license number, it&rsquo;s useless to speculate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd that the boat was showing no lights,&rdquo; Dan
said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Also, I wonder if it carried a
license?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time even the faint roar of the motorboat&rsquo;s
engine had died away far up the river. Mr.
Holloway and the Cubs knew by following the
sound that the craft had not returned to the Webster
City Yacht Club. Where it would dock they could
not guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll try to make those men pay for the damage,
won&rsquo;t you, Dad?&rdquo; Midge demanded. The shore
now was so close he could see the twinkling lights
which marked the outline of the yacht club slip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly will if I can, Midge. Unfortunately,
we have no proof it was Manheim&rsquo;s boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have a few scratches to show, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we notice tomorrow that his speedboat is
banged up, we can be quite certain he&rsquo;s the guilty
party. Even so, we&rsquo;ll have to be rather careful in
taking the matter up with him. Manheim has many
friends in the club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t have &rsquo;em long if he makes a practice
of running down sailboats,&rdquo; said Midge. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
lucky our boat didn&rsquo;t sink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later, the dinghy, heavily logged
with water, limped to its berth at the yacht club
dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry on to your Cub Scout meeting, boys,&rdquo;
Mr. Holloway urged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after the boat and
make a few inquiries around the club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged, Dan and Midge hastened along a
graveled path which curled toward a steep hillside
overlooking the water front.</p>
<p>A long flight of wooden steps led up to a natural
limestone cave in the rocks high above the beach.
Some months before, the Cubs by hard labor had
converted this cavern into a meeting place. The
room now was attractively furnished with a couch,
table, magazines and trophies.</p>
<p>Breathless from hurrying, the boys reached the
Cave entranceway. Already the Cub meeting was
in progress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Sam Hatfield, athletic coach at Webster High
School, and Cub leader, stood in the center of the
cavern talking earnestly to the boys.</p>
<p>Grouped about him in the lighted room were
Brad Wilber who was Den Chief, Chips Davis, Red
Suell, Mack Tibbets, and Sam&rsquo;s own son, Fred Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, boys,&rdquo; the Cub leader greeted
Dan and Midge. &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t you a little late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stammering apologies, Dan and Midge explained
that they had been delayed on the river. Without
mentioning Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s name, they related how
their boat had been smashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew something unusual must have kept you
away from the meeting,&rdquo; declared the Cub leader.
&ldquo;Too bad about Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s boat. I hope you
catch those fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we missed much of the meeting, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;
Dan asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the treasure hunt,&rdquo; the Cub leader reassured
him. &ldquo;We just wound up the business meeting.
Briefly, the Den has decided upon two goals for
the summer. The first is to win the Pack swimming
meet next month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you come in, Dan,&rdquo; spoke up Brad.
Nearly fourteen, the dark-haired youngster was a
Boy Scout and the acknowledged leader of the
Cubs. Even-tempered, quick of wit and fair, he had
earned the respect of the younger, boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; Dan caught him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best swimmer in the outfit. We&rsquo;re depending
on you to crash through and win the silver
cup for Den 2.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; Dan promised with a pleased
grin. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll have to get busy right away and
polish off my crawl stroke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the second goal, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo; Midge
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the Cubs have voted to help the Scouts
earn enough money to buy a permanent camp on
Skeleton Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skeleton Island?&rdquo; Midge repeated, glancing
quickly at Dan. &ldquo;Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the camp will belong to the Scouts, but our
Den will have the privilege of using it for day trips
and occasional over-night jaunts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need both your votes on the project,&rdquo; Brad
interposed. &ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s to be a Scout rather than a
Cub camp, we don&rsquo;t aim to go into it unless every
member of the Den is in favor of the idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why buy a chunk of Skeleton Island?&rdquo; Midge
inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only suitable island hereabouts,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield explained. &ldquo;We figure Mr. Manheim
shouldn&rsquo;t ask too high a figure for a small beach
section. Of course, if you boys are against the
project&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have my vote,&rdquo; Dan said after a slight
hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; added Midge, a trifle reluctantly. &ldquo;I
just hope you&rsquo;re right about Mr. Manheim being
generous enough to sell at a low price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being uncertain that their dinghy had been struck
by Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s motorboat, neither Midge nor
Dan told the Cubs why mention of his name had
disturbed them.</p>
<p>The business meeting presently ended with the
boys gathering in a circle to repeat the Cub Promise.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I promise TO DO MY BEST</p>
<p class="t0">To be SQUARE and</p>
<p class="t0">To OBEY the law of the Cub Pack.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Parents began to drift into the Cave. On this particular
night, a beach treasure hunt had been
planned. Everything now was in readiness. Clues
had been carefully hidden throughout the beach
area.</p>
<p>Red Suell&rsquo;s father handed out typewritten slips
of paper containing hints in scrambled letters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to hunt in pairs,&rdquo; he instructed the Cubs.
&ldquo;The treasure chest has been hidden somewhere
within a quarter mile of the Cave. The first pair to
find it should signal by giving the Cub whistle. Then
we&rsquo;ll all join on the beach for a feed before going
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad drew identical numbers which
meant they were to hunt together. Eagerly they
scanned their slip of paper on which appeared the
scrambled sentence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinf eht glgyascr koa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first two words are &lsquo;find the&mdash;,&rsquo;&rdquo; Dan discerned
at a glance. &ldquo;But what are those other two
mind-teasers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last one is oak,&rdquo; Brad contributed. &ldquo;&lsquo;Find the
oak!&rsquo; But what kind of oak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scraggly oak!&rdquo; Dan deciphered the final word.
&ldquo;Come on, Brad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a shout, the two boys were off, leaving the
other Cubs to puzzle out their various clues. Clattering
down the steps, the pair raced across the
smooth sand.</p>
<p>The light of a pale moon plainly silhouetted a
stunted oak tree against the dark sky. Making a bee
line for it, the boys searched diligently for another
clue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; Dan suddenly shouted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>At the base of the tree he had found a small cardboard
box. Inside was another scrambled sentence
which directed the boys to search for a large piece
of driftwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beach is littered with washed-up debris,&rdquo;
Brad observed. &ldquo;This game is getting tougher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other Cubs now began to appear on the water
front. However, as each clue was different, the treasure
hunters remained widely separated.</p>
<p>Brad and Dan turned up perhaps twenty pieces
of driftwood before they found their third clue. The
scrambled message required a long time to decipher.
On a ragged piece of cardboard had been
printed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kloo denur a toab dna ouy amy dinf a hsoelv.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look under a boat and you may find a shovel!&rdquo;
Dan finally figured it out. &ldquo;A shovel! Yipee! That
means we&rsquo;re getting close to the treasure chest.
Maybe our next clue will lead us to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re miles ahead of the other Cubs,&rdquo;
chuckled Brad. &ldquo;The question is, where&rsquo;s the boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither boy could recall having seen one on the
beach that day. Because their clue had directed
them to search beneath the craft, they were convinced
that the boat must be an old one, probably
overturned or abandoned somewhere on the sands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look on that stretch that extends out toward
the lighthouse,&rdquo; Brad proposed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lonely spot&mdash;just
the type of place you&rsquo;d expect the Den Dads
to select for the big treasure chest pay-off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scanning every inch of the sand, the boys dog-trotted
toward the lighthouse. As its bright beam
swept across the water, Dan noticed a dark outline
on the beach some distance ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks like a boat!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Focusing their eyes upon it, the boys plunged on
through the loose sand. In the semi-darkness Dan
paid scant heed to his footing. He stumbled, and
then suddenly halted, staring ahead.</p>
<p>A dark object lay half hidden behind a little
mound of sand. Unmistakably, the form was human.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;<i>Jeepers!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad too had seen the figure in the sand and had
halted with a jerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Not a joke the Den
Dads are pulling on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The form at their feet was that of a boy no older
than Dan. One arm outstretched, he lay in a posture
of complete exhaustion. His clothing was water-soaked,
his dark hair damp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no joke,&rdquo; Brad said soberly. &ldquo;Whoever
this youngster is, he&rsquo;s in bad shape.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER 2</span>
<br />A Coded Message</h2>
<p>The dark, curly-haired boy who lay on the sand
stirred slightly as Dan and Brad bent down to shake
his arm.</p>
<p>Seeing their faces above him, he pulled himself
up on an elbow, staring at them with blank expression.</p>
<p>Fear gleamed momentarily in his steel-gray eyes,
and then he seemed to relax. With a tired sigh, he
settled back, clutching convulsively at the sand.</p>
<p>Though the Cubs tried twice to arouse him, he
did not respond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s completely worn out,&rdquo; Brad said, deeply
troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously he&rsquo;s been in the river,&rdquo; Dan added.
&ldquo;My guess is he&rsquo;s exhausted from a long swim. Ever
see him before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure he never
went to any of the Webster City schools or I&rsquo;d remember
him. Must be a newcomer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever he is, he shouldn&rsquo;t lie here in wet
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Dan. He&rsquo;ll catch his death in this
night air. And he probably needs medical attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we could carry him to the Cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by ourselves, Dan. We need the other Cubs
to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wetting his fingers, Brad gave the shrill whistle
which had been agreed upon as the signal to mark
the end of the treasure hunt.</p>
<p>Immediately the other Cubs began to gather from
all sections of the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! What fast workers you little guys are!&rdquo;
Mack Tibbets complained goodnaturedly as he hurried
up. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t take you long to dig up the
chest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t found it yet,&rdquo; Brad replied. &ldquo;But we
have stumbled into something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already Mack&rsquo;s startled gaze had fastened upon
the sprawled figure of the boy on the sand. Before
he could comment, Mr. Hatfield and the other Cubs
arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; the Cub leader demanded, stopping
short.</p>
<p>Dan explained how he and Brad had found the
strange boy lying on the sand, adding: &ldquo;The kid
raised up a second and then lapsed off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unconscious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, sir,&rdquo; Brad replied. &ldquo;He seemed
more exhausted than anything else. We haven&rsquo;t
touched him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield knelt in the sand, feeling the boy&rsquo;s
pulse which was weak and fast. Carefully he turned
him over to look directly into his face.</p>
<p>Again the eyelids fluttered open and his lips
moved slightly. Mr. Hatfield bent closer but could
not distinguish the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any idea who he is?&rdquo; he asked the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never saw him before,&rdquo; Brad answered. &ldquo;We
were looking for the treasure when Dan noticed him
lying here by the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have crawled from the water only a
few minutes ago,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. The Cub leader
had noticed long marks in the sand, indicating that
the boy had dragged himself beyond reach of the
waves. &ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;d better send for an ambulance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words trailed off, for the boy on the sand unexpectedly
had stirred to life. As if aroused by hearing
the Cub leader&rsquo;s remark, he tried to sit up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, lad,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield advised, placing a supporting
arm about his shoulders. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you to
a hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s head shook in a vigorous negative. His
fingers gripped Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s arm in a hard pressure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he whispered fiercely. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puzzled by the intensity of the boy&rsquo;s reaction, Mr.
Hatfield studied him a moment in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been in the river?&rdquo; he asked as the other
offered no information.</p>
<p>Again the head bobbed, this time in an affirmative
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield inquired, stripping
off his leather jacket and wrapping it about
the shivering boy. &ldquo;How did you get in the
river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy merely stared at the Cub leader and did
not answer. Then with a supreme effort, he tried to
pull away from the supporting arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;All right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will you go?&rdquo; interposed the Cub leader.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish. You&rsquo;re in no condition to walk.
Come on, boys. Let&rsquo;s take him to the Cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having no stretcher or board which could be used
as one, Brad and Mr. Hatfield made a seat of their
arms and carried the boy to the steps leading up
into the Cave. There they were joined by Mr. Holloway
and Red&rsquo;s father who helped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Once in the Cave, the Cubs made the boy comfortable
on a couch. Stripping off his wet garments,
they wrapped him in a warm blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feeling better?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked him. &ldquo;I think
I should call a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;please,&rdquo; he mumbled, pleading with his
eyes.</p>
<p>To Mr. Hatfield and the fathers of the Cubs it was
apparent that the boy slowly was recovering from
his ordeal in the river. And it also was evident that
for some reason, he did not wish to reveal anything
about himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you tell us your name,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
suggested, seating himself beside the boy.</p>
<p>The youth regarded him with a stony stare and
answered no word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll tell us a little later,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said kindly.</p>
<p>Deciding to leave the boy alone for awhile, he retired
to a far corner of the Cave to talk over the
matter with Mr. Suell and Midge&rsquo;s father. Neither
the Cubs nor their fathers ever had seen the boy
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer how he came to be in the river,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield remarked in an undertone. &ldquo;Plainly, he&rsquo;s
trying to hide something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think we should turn him over to the police for
investigation?&rdquo; Mr. Holloway asked, looking troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems like a good sort,&rdquo; the Cub leader replied.
&ldquo;My judgment would be to wait and see what
develops. He may be suffering from shock, though
I think his refusal to talk is deliberate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan, who had taken charge of the boy&rsquo;s
wet garments, now approached Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, boys?&rdquo; he inquired, aware by their
manner that they had an important disclosure to
make.</p>
<p>Brad asked the Cub leader if he would step outside
to a platform from which the wooden steps
descended.</p>
<p>Surprised by the request, Mr. Hatfield followed
the two Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; he questioned when they were beyond
the hearing of the others. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve learned
something about that youngster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were hanging up his clothes, and sort of
went through his pockets,&rdquo; Brad confessed. &ldquo;Maybe
we shouldn&rsquo;t have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the whole, I think I might have done the
same,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield reassured him. &ldquo;The boy evidently
has no intention of telling us anything about
himself. So I figure it&rsquo;s up to us to puzzle out a few
facts for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what we found,&rdquo; Dan said, offering Mr.
Hatfield a scrap of heavy wrapping paper.</p>
<p>The Cub leader snapped on his flashlight to study
the writing. Only two words appeared, preceded by
a string of puzzling numerals.</p>
<pre>  &ldquo;020614     7552845     24
               Skeleton Island.&rdquo;</pre>
<p>&ldquo;Queer,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield commented. &ldquo;You say this
paper came from the boy&rsquo;s pocket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was wadded up inside an old cigarette
case,&rdquo; Dan explained. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s, why it wasn&rsquo;t water-soaked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a couple of handkerchiefs, a pocket knife
and a few odds and ends,&rdquo; Brad replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to indicate who the boy is or where he
came from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing, sir. The only clue is this scrap of
paper. What do you make of it, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, I&rsquo;m puzzled, Brad. This reference to
Skeleton Island seems very odd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose those numerals could be a code
of some sort?&rdquo; Dan asked eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s hard to say. But by all means hang
on to this paper, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure will,&rdquo; Dan promised, replacing it in his
pocket. &ldquo;If it should be a code maybe we can work
it out. The only trouble is, I wouldn&rsquo;t know where
to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Footsteps now were heard padding softly on the
steps leading to the platform.</p>
<p>Gazing down, the Cubs saw that it was Mrs. Holloway,
who had arrived. The official Den Mother
climbed slowly, carrying a heavy hamper of food.</p>
<p>Dan and Brad darted down the stairs to help with
the basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, these steps seem steeper every time I
climb them,&rdquo; she laughed, pausing on the platform
to recapture her breath.</p>
<p>Observing through the open doorway of the Cave
that all the Cubs had gathered there, Mrs. Holloway
expressed surprise that the treasure hunt had ended
so early.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m late bringing the food!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I expected the beach outing to last at least another
half hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield told her what had occurred, adding:
&ldquo;Perhaps you can do something for the boy. He&rsquo;s
inside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sent for a doctor?&rdquo; Mrs. Holloway inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Suell went after Dr. Redfield a few minutes
ago. The lad seems to be coming around all
right. He&rsquo;s a strange sort of boy&mdash;so far, he won&rsquo;t
tell us his name or anything about himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out,&rdquo; Mrs. Holloway said confidently.</p>
<p>Inside the Cave, nearly all of the Cubs had
gathered about the couch where the strange boy lay.
His dark brown eyes now appeared alert, and roved
systematically over the room, taking in every
detail.</p>
<p>He noted an animal skin which hung on the wall
above the couch, a shelf of Indian handicraft articles,
and raffia baskets made by the Cubs. His gaze
dwelt longest upon a silver trophy engraved with
the Den 2 name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won that cup in the Pack handicraft show,&rdquo;
Chips volunteered, observing the boy&rsquo;s interest.
&ldquo;Red and I made an Indian headdress which took
top honors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, cut out the boasting,&rdquo; Red interposed with
a laugh. &ldquo;Remember, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Brad and
Dan recovering that feather war bonnet after it was
carried down river with the flood, the Den wouldn&rsquo;t
have won a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Chips admitted readily. &ldquo;We all
worked together to earn the trophy. And to clear the
Den name too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As all the Cubs knew, the feathers which had
been so skillfully woven into the headdress had
been obtained from the Silverton Pheasant Farm
not many miles distant.</p>
<p>Due to a misunderstanding, all the Cubs had been
accused of trespassing, and Chips and Red of stealing.
Only by diligent work had Dan and Brad
cleared the two boys of the charge.</p>
<p>The story of how a group of daring pheasant
thieves was brought to justice, has been told in the
first volume of a series, entitled: &ldquo;Dan Carter, Cub
Scout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quietly taking charge, Mrs. Holloway cleared the
bedside by assigning the Cubs to small tasks about
the Cave. From a thermos bottle she poured a
steaming cup of hot chocolate which she pressed to
the boy&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>He drank slowly and then with a grateful smile
expressed his thanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re feeling better now, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the Den
Mother said, straightening the blankets on the
couch.</p>
<p>The boy nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not very talkative, are you?&rdquo; Mrs. Holloway
asked with a warm smile. &ldquo;But then, you&rsquo;ve had a
most harrowing experience. How in the world did
you get in the river so late at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strange lad did not rise to this bait, but allowed
the question to remain unanswered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told us your name yet,&rdquo; Mrs. Holloway
reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques,&rdquo; he answered after a long hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s a French name, isn&rsquo;t it? Jacques&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the boy did not answer, merely staring at
her with eyes which held a troubled expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Mrs. Holloway. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t
feel like answering questions, I won&rsquo;t press you.
Later on perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell us about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat by the couch for a few minutes and then
as Mr. Suell came in with Dr. Redfield, retired to
talk to the Cub leader again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t get a word out of him,&rdquo;
she confessed. &ldquo;My guess is that he is foreign-born.
And his first name, Jacques, would indicate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of the Cubs ever have seen him before,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield remarked. &ldquo;A slip of paper was found in
his pocket bearing the name Skeleton Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he may live there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield conceded. &ldquo;However, the
island belongs to Jonathan Manheim. I&rsquo;ve never
heard of anyone staying there except a caretaker
who looks after the property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done with the boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to try to find his people. Possibly he&rsquo;s
a runaway. In that case, he may refuse to tell us the
name of his parents or where he came from. It may
take a day or two to get his background.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to have him stay at my home tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d figured on taking him with me,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
replied. &ldquo;That is, if the doctor approves. Let&rsquo;s see
what he has to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Redfield had completed his examination of
the boy and was preparing to leave the Cave. Not
wishing to discuss the patient in his presence, he
joined the Cub leader and Mrs. Holloway outside
on the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the verdict, doctor?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he should be all right by tomorrow morning,&rdquo;
the doctor answered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s suffering a little
from shock, but nothing serious. Mr. Suell told me
the boy was found on the beach and apparently
had become exhausted from a long swim.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way we figured it out. He&rsquo;s told us
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy has no serious injuries,&rdquo; Dr. Redfield
continued. &ldquo;In examining him, I did find several
bruises on his legs and back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you say was the cause, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be certain, but offhand I would think
he had been beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then our theory that he&rsquo;s a runaway may be
right after all. By the way, doctor, the boy can be
moved safely? I thought I&rsquo;d take him to my home
for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right if he doesn&rsquo;t exert himself,&rdquo; the
doctor replied. &ldquo;Keep him warm and quiet. If you
need me in the morning, telephone and I&rsquo;ll make a
more complete examination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the doctor had gone, Mr. Hatfield and the
Cubs prepared to close up the Cave for the night.
Deciding to leave the treasure chest buried on the
beach, the boys voted to resume the interrupted
hunt at their next weekly meeting.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holloway served sandwiches, chocolate and
cookies to all the Cubs. Jacques refused to eat anything
but did accept another cup of hot beverage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s all sing the Cub pledge before we
leave,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield proposed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>The boys gathered around and to the tune of
America, warbled:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Cub friendships, pure and deep,</p>
<p class="t0">We promise we will keep</p>
<p class="t0">Our pledge to thee;</p>
<p class="t0">We will honor and obey Akela all the way</p>
<p class="t0">And on that twelfth birthday</p>
<p class="t0">Good Scouts we&rsquo;ll be!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>At the end of the song, all the Cubs gave the
salute, two fingers raised to their foreheads. Then
the meeting began to break up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad, if you and Dan will stay here with Jacques,
I&rsquo;ll go home for my car,&rdquo; the Cub leader said. &ldquo;Then
we can get him down the stairs and directly into
the automobile. It shouldn&rsquo;t take me long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to wait,&rdquo; Dan offered eagerly.</p>
<p>After Mr. Hatfield had gone, the Cubs and their
fathers began to drift off home. Soon only Mrs.
Holloway, her son Midge, Brad and Dan remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for Mr. Hatfield,&rdquo; the Den Mother said.
&ldquo;He should be coming soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a car parking now on the road across from
the beach,&rdquo; Brad observed. From where he stood
near the Cave doorway, he could view the entire
river front.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll run along,&rdquo; Mrs. Holloway said, gathering
up hamper and thermos bottles. &ldquo;Good-bye,
Jacques. I&rsquo;ll certainly see you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Merci</i>,&rdquo; he mumbled, using the French word for
expressing thanks.</p>
<p>The Cave became deeply silent after Mrs. Holloway
had gone. Brad and Dan moved close to the
couch, studying their guest with curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques, can&rsquo;t you speak English, or don&rsquo;t you
want to?&rdquo; Brad asked presently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to
hide something&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the boy on the couch flashed them an inscrutable
smile. But with a gesture which plainly
bespoke gratitude, he reached out to grasp Dan&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>His next act was deliberate. With two fingers extended
along Dan&rsquo;s wrist, he squeezed the hand
with a grip which unmistakably was the official Cub
handclasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh all fish hooks!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed, staring
down at the boy in astonishment. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Cub
too! And you never let out a hint of it when the
others were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacques allowed the boy&rsquo;s hand to slip from his
own. With a slight shrug and another mysterious
smile, he closed his eyes and pretended to drowse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER 3</span>
<br />Stolen Furs</h2>
<p>On the morrow, Dan and Brad called early at Mr.
Hatfield&rsquo;s home to inquire as to the condition of
Jacques.</p>
<p>They found the boy up and dressed, eating a late
breakfast with Mr. and Mrs. Hatfield and Fred.
Apparently none the worse for his river adventure
of the previous night, the lad seemed in fairly good
spirits.</p>
<p>Taking Brad and Dan aside, Fred reported to
them that absolutely no progress had been made in
learning the boy&rsquo;s identity or anything about his
past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as soon as one asks him a direct question,
he pretends not to understand,&rdquo; Fred complained.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a pose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does your father plan to do with him?&rdquo;
Brad asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t decided yet. This afternoon we&rsquo;re
going down to the Cave to clean up after last night&rsquo;s
meeting. We&rsquo;ll probably take Jacques with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know he&rsquo;s a Cub, I suppose,&rdquo; Dan remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Cub!&rdquo; Fred was astonished. &ldquo;Why, no! He
didn&rsquo;t give us a hint of it. What makes you think
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad related how Jacques had grasped
the former&rsquo;s hand in the official Cub handclasp,
mute evidence that he once had been a member of
the international organization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a queer duck,&rdquo; Fred declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he
didn&rsquo;t mention to Dad that he ever had been a Cub.
Fact is, he&rsquo;s kept mum about everything. Won&rsquo;t
peep a word as to his folks or where he came from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs discussed Jacques a little longer, and
then Brad and Dan left, but not before promising
Fred they would drop around at the Cave later to
help with the cleaning.</p>
<p>Anxious to learn how much damage had been
done the previous night to Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s sailboat,
the boys next stopped at the Webster City Yacht
Club. From Midge, who loitered on the dock, they
learned that the sailing craft already had been
hauled to a nearby boat yard to be repaired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The job will cost at least forty dollars,&rdquo; Midge
reported. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s worse, the boat will be out of
water for at least two or three days. It makes me
sick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did your father learn if it was Manheim&rsquo;s boat
that struck us last night?&rdquo; Dan questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. We inquired around the clubhouse, but
no one has seen the Manheim speedboat the last
couple of days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad had noticed a mahogany speedcraft which
was plowing up the channel at half-speed. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
that Manheim&rsquo;s boat coming now?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;It looks like it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likewise the same one that struck us last night,&rdquo;
Midge muttered, shading his eyes as he gazed
toward the sun.</p>
<p>As the three Cubs watched, the boat drew closer
until they could read the license numbers&mdash;D 351,
and see the bright gleam of her brasswork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boat that hit us had no visible license,&rdquo; Dan
said, a little troubled. &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for that, I&rsquo;d
say it was Manheim&rsquo;s craft that smashed into
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s at the wheel?&rdquo; Brad demanded. &ldquo;Not
Manheim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The operator of the boat wore a striped red and
blue jersey and soiled brown trousers. His square
jaw and grizzled sun-brown face of set expression
marked him as a man of surly temper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>As the boat slid along toward the Manheim berth,
he glanced briefly at the Cubs. Then deliberately
he looked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder who he is?&rdquo; Midge muttered. &ldquo;He
doesn&rsquo;t resemble anyone in that boat last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the operator anyway,&rdquo; Dan agreed. &ldquo;Actually,
we didn&rsquo;t see the other two fellows well
enough to recognize them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs kept the boat in view as it maneuvered
into a reserved space at the far end of the dock.
Midge asked a club member, who loitered nearby,
if the speedboat belonged to Mr. Manheim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s his boat,&rdquo; the club member identified
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t Mr. Manheim at the wheel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the pilot is a fellow who works for him at
Skeleton Island. A new man he hired a few months
ago. I&rsquo;ve heard him called Wilson Jabowski.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the club member had moved on, the three
Cubs watched the Manheim boat fill its gas tank at
a private pump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice her stern,&rdquo; Dan whispered to his companions.
&ldquo;Can you see any scratches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re too far away,&rdquo; Midge returned. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll
bet a frosted doughnut it was Manheim&rsquo;s boat that
rammed us last night! I&rsquo;ll find out!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Unable to restrain himself, the boy descended
three steps to the lower level, there to inspect the
craft&rsquo;s hull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; the boat operator shouted as Midge bent
to look closely at the mahogany. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you think
you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Midge mumbled, startled. &ldquo;Just looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do your lookin&rsquo; somewhere else!&rdquo; the man
snapped. &ldquo;Mr. Manheim doesn&rsquo;t want kids hangin&rsquo;
around his boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not doing any harm,&rdquo; Midge defended himself.
&ldquo;I was just noticing a few scratches on your
boat. Have you been in an accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the boat operator answered gruffly. &ldquo;I may
have scratched the mahogany a couple of days ago
when I was backing out of the berth. Grazed a dock
post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; Midge said, pretending to accept the
explanation. &ldquo;I thought maybe you might have been
in a collision last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collision! What you drivin&rsquo; at, you young whelp?
Trying to make out it was Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s boat that
run into your Dad&rsquo;s sailboat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so, did I? Anyhow, how did you
know of it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heard about the accident here at the club,&rdquo; the
boat operator retorted. &ldquo;Let me tell you something!
This boat wasn&rsquo;t away from Skeleton Island last
night! And another thing, Mr. Manheim doesn&rsquo;t go
around smashing sailboats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said he did?&rdquo; Midge demanded, now on
the defensive. &ldquo;I never accused him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but you&rsquo;re thinking it was this boat that hit
yours. Oh, I heard you boys whispering! Well, get
this straight! You better not go to Mr. Manheim
with your complaints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I said anything to offend,&rdquo; Midge
replied, his voice stony. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I
did think maybe it was his boat that struck ours in
the dark. If I&rsquo;ve made a mistake I apologize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure made a mistake, kid. Now get going
all of you! I want to fill this gasoline tank and get
back to Skeleton Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Embarrassed by the reprimand, the three Cubs
took themselves to the club where they sat on the
veranda drinking cokes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure made the old boy sore,&rdquo; Midge said between
sips of the iced drink. &ldquo;I never intended to
accuse him or say anything about the accident. He
snapped me up so fast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Almost as if he had a guilty conscience,&rdquo; Dan
agreed. &ldquo;Maybe he heard about the accident here
at the club the way he said. Then again, maybe he
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those scratches on the boat weren&rsquo;t very deep,&rdquo;
Midge said thoughtfully. &ldquo;All in all, I guess I&rsquo;d
better not exercise my gums too much over the
thing. Dad wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad, who had been scanning the morning paper
while his companions talked, now uttered a startled
snort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, will you look at this!&rdquo; he exclaimed, tapping
a front page news story. &ldquo;Guess what happened last
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break it to us gently, Brad, my boy,&rdquo; Midge
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It says here that a box of furs valued at $8,500
was stolen last night from Pier 23. So far the police
haven&rsquo;t traced the thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan relieved Brad of the newspaper and read the
account for himself. The story related that during
the early hours of the evening, a fast motorboat had
pulled alongside of Pier 23 where a box of furs had
been piled up with other merchandise for shipment.
Before the warehouse watchman had suspected
what was happening, the craft with its unknown
occupants had sped away into the darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, do you suppose that could have been the
same boat that struck us last night?&rdquo; Dan demanded
as he finished reading the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time did the robbery occur?&rdquo; Midge asked
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story doesn&rsquo;t say. But you remember, the
boat was showing no lights, and coming from the
general direction of the docks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Midge admitted, impressed. &ldquo;All
the same, Manheim isn&rsquo;t the type of man to get
mixed up in a fur theft. In the first place, he has
plenty of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may have been mistaken about it being the
Manheim boat,&rdquo; Dan argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case, this story about the fur theft is interesting,&rdquo;
Brad said, rereading it. &ldquo;It looks to me
as if the river pirates are getting pretty bold when
they can pull off a robbery practically under the
eyes of the watchman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had more information,&rdquo; Midge remarked.
&ldquo;Pier 23 isn&rsquo;t far from here. Why not go
there and see if we can pick up any more information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposal appealed to Brad and Dan. Finishing
their drinks, they caught a bus which dropped
them off a few minutes later at the commercial
area of the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Midge, who was fairly familiar with this section
of the waterfront, led his companions toward a small
warehouse whose corrugated steel door stood
slightly ajar.</p>
<p>Inside, an elderly man was taking an inventory
of boxes and crates stacked against the wall. A spry,
wiry little fellow with white hair and energy that
belied his sixty-nine years, he whirled around as
he heard the boys enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You startled me,&rdquo; he chuckled, obviously relieved.
&ldquo;After last night, I&rsquo;m a mite jumpy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs noticed then that the warehouse man
carried a revolver in a holster at his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Hank Hawkins, at your service,&rdquo; he announced
cheerfully. &ldquo;What can I do for you youngsters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like a little information about the robbery
last night,&rdquo; Dan spoke up. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not just asking
questions out of curiosity. We may have some information
for you too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kids know something about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may have seen the boat that pulled away
from the pier. We&rsquo;re not sure. What time did the
robbery take place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, who are you kids anyhow?&rdquo; the watchman
demanded, without answering the question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Brad gave his name and introduced his companions,
explaining that they were Cub Scouts. &ldquo;I guess
you think we have our nerve barging in like this,&rdquo;
he added. &ldquo;We read about the fur robbery in the
paper, and we want to learn the details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Hank sat down on a packing case to light
his pipe. &ldquo;Well, there ain&rsquo;t much to tell. The Hodur
and Fameister firm sent through a box of expensive
furs. They were to have been picked up at 10 o&rsquo;clock
last night by the freighter <i>Albone</i>. At eight thirty
I set out the box along with some others that were
to go. Then I stepped back into the warehouse for
a minute, and it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say the theft occurred about eight thirty?&rdquo;
Dan asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was about that time. Ordinarily, it wouldn&rsquo;t
have been dark, but a heavy fog had rolled in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the motorboat and the men in it?&rdquo;
Midge asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught a glimpse of &rsquo;em as they pulled away&mdash;that
was all. It all happened so fast. They had that
box off the pier and were gone before I knew what
was up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of boat was it?&rdquo; Brad inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A 20-ft. high-powered speedboat. Mostly she was
a blur in the dark. Not a light showing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How many in the boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The information tended to convince the Cubs
that the craft was the same one that had smashed
into Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s sailboat.</p>
<p>As they were telling Hank about the incident, a
tapping sound was heard on the planking outside
the door. A moment later, a blindman led by a seeing-eye
dog, groped his way into the warehouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Joe,&rdquo; the watchman greeted him.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s business today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lousy,&rdquo; the blindman complained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sold
only four packages of pencils all morning. The sun&rsquo;s
so hot it&rsquo;s wilting me. Mind if I chin for a few minutes
while I cool off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to have you,&rdquo; Hank said, guiding the man
to a seat on a box. &ldquo;Boys, meet Joe Matt, a friend of
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs gave their own names. Feeling sorry for
the man, Brad then bought a package of pencils for
a quarter. However, the blindman pocketed the coin
rather indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you hear from the cops?&rdquo; he asked
Hank. &ldquo;Any clue as to the fur thieves?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently it was a clean get-away. The box
was insured for only half its value and that makes
it tough for Hodur and Fameister. I&rsquo;m lucky I didn&rsquo;t
lose my job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should anyone blame you?&rdquo; the blindman
demanded. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but maybe my employer will figure I should
have had my eyes open a little wider. It&rsquo;s the first
time I&rsquo;ve lost anything in the eighteen years I&rsquo;ve
been workin&rsquo; on the waterfront.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hank discussed the theft at length and then began
to tell other tales of the waterfront which kept
the Cubs enthralled. Brad, Dan, and Midge presently
found themselves drawn into the conversation.
They told of their Cave on the hillside and the exciting
treasure hunt which had led to the discovery
of Jacques lying on the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques?&rdquo; the blindman interposed. &ldquo;Is that his
name? Must be one of those foreigners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;French, we think,&rdquo; Midge revealed, failing to
notice the look of intent interest in the blindman&rsquo;s
otherwise mask-like face. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not much to
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t told you anything about himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the youngster now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be at the Cave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>The blindman talked a few minutes more and
then arose to leave. Dan also slid down from the
packing box on which he had perched himself.</p>
<p>Slight as was the movement, it disturbed the
seeing-eye dog. With a snarl, he sprang at the boy.</p>
<p>Startled, Dan leaped backward. The blindman
uttered a sharp command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Rudy! Come here! Behave yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still growling and eyeing Dan with deep hate,
the dog allowed his master to grasp him by the
leash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a vicious dog you have there,&rdquo; Brad said,
edging away. &ldquo;He might have taken a chunk out of
Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rudy isn&rsquo;t vicious,&rdquo; the blindman denied. &ldquo;Now
and then he takes a dislike to someone. Usually he
won&rsquo;t attack unless he&rsquo;s annoyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s encouraging,&rdquo; Dan said with a wry grin.
&ldquo;Believe me, in the future I&rsquo;ll take pains not to
annoy him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without apologizing for the incident, the blindman
took the dog and went off down the wharf. For
a long while, the Cubs could hear his cane tapping
on the planks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Matt isn&rsquo;t a bad sort after you know him,&rdquo;
the watchman remarked, aware that the Cubs had
not been favorably impressed by the man&rsquo;s manners.
&ldquo;Being blind would make anyone out-of-sorts,
I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Brad agreed. &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s attached to
that dog&mdash;though he&rsquo;s an ugly animal. Wouldn&rsquo;t
want to meet him on a dark night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can bet I&rsquo;ll give him a wide berth,&rdquo; Dan
added with a laugh. &ldquo;Rudy didn&rsquo;t go for me. And
the feeling&rsquo;s mutual! By the way, Hank, how long
have you known Joe Matt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; the watchman replied
indifferently, knocking the ashes from his pipe. &ldquo;Six
months maybe. Well, I&rsquo;ve been spinning yarns long
enough. Got to do a little work now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accepting the remark as a dismissal, Dan, Brad
and Midge said goodbye, and left the warehouse.
At the bus line, they debated, and finally decided
to make an appearance at the Cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holloway and Fred will need some help
cleaning up the place,&rdquo; Dan declared. &ldquo;Also, if
Jacques is there, I&rsquo;d like to talk to him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed to go for you more than anyone
else,&rdquo; Brad said, signaling to a bus driver. &ldquo;Maybe
you can get him to loosen up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun was high overhead as the three Cubs
alighted from the bus ten minutes later. Crossing
the beach, they climbed to the Cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>Entering, they saw at once that something was
amiss. Mr. Holloway and Fred were there alone,
their brooms discarded. Rather dejectedly they sat
at a table, studying an object which was hidden
from view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; Dan greeted the pair. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jacques?
We thought you were bringing him here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did,&rdquo; replied Fred significantly.</p>
<p>The other Cubs looked quickly about the disordered
room. Plainly Jacques was nowhere in the
Cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Brad demanded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep us
in suspense. He didn&rsquo;t take a turn for the worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jacques appeared fine when last we saw
him. This will explain.&rdquo; He thrust a note into Brad&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;The lad left it here a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a large, hard-to-read scrawl, the boy had
written:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for everything. Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beneath the message appeared a crudely drawn
Wolf cub, its sharp ears pointing to the final word:
&ldquo;Jacques.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER 4</span>
<br />Fluke Victory</h2>
<p>Jacques&rsquo; unexpected leave-taking came as a bitter
disappointment to Brad and Dan who had hoped
to learn more about the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where he went or why,&rdquo; Fred
explained to the Cubs as they reread the farewell
message. &ldquo;Dad and I carried a basket of trash down
to the beach, leaving Jacques here. When we came
back, he was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was only a few minutes ago,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
added. &ldquo;Dan, you and Brad didn&rsquo;t see the boy anywhere
on the beach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan replied that they had observed no one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad and I weren&rsquo;t away from the Cave ten minutes,&rdquo;
Fred further explained. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand
what got into Jacques. He seemed cheerful earlier
this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he was afraid we&rsquo;d ask too many questions,&rdquo;
Brad commented, his gaze roving slowly
about the room. &ldquo;Say, isn&rsquo;t there something different
about this place?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Different?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield echoed. &ldquo;A chair has
been upset and another one shoved against the wall.
Come to think of it, both those chairs were in place
when Fred and I carried out the trash!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe someone came here while you were away
and forced Jacques to leave!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy seemed well enough satisfied this morning,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield said, folding and buttoning the
note into his jacket pocket. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes it
seem strange that he&rsquo;d leave without explaining.
Suppose we look around down on the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eager to search for clues, the boys clattered down
the stairway ahead of the Cub leader.</p>
<p>At the foot of the steps they noticed several
freshly made footsteps in the sand. Scattered among
the imprints left by a small shoe were those of a
man&rsquo;s heavy-soled footgear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, your theory about someone forcing Jacques
to leave may be correct!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield exclaimed.
&ldquo;The boy may have gone willingly enough. But that
upset chair makes me wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now rather excited by their discoveries, the Cubs
followed the footprint trail for twenty yards along
the beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Now and then, a small circular mark appeared
near the shoe prints. To the observing Cubs this
indicated that a stick or similar round object had
been carried by Jacques&rsquo; companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see here!&rdquo; Midge exclaimed, staring at a
confusion of prints in the sand. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t this look
as if a scuffle took place, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; agreed the Cub leader, praising Midge
for his observation. &ldquo;Either Jacques stumbled or was
given a hard shove. One can see plainly where he
fell down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trail of footprints led the Cubs on to a paved
road paralleling the river front. There it abruptly
ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve lost them,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said, gazing
up and down the deserted highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ll never know who Jacques was or
where he came from,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;About all he told
us was that he&rsquo;s a Cub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even that seems odd,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield commented.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve checked, and Jacques never was a member of
any Webster City Den. I only hope that whoever
took the boy away treats him right. Those bruises
the doctor mentioned, rather trouble me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Failure to learn what had become of Jacques disturbed
not only Mr. Hatfield but all of the Cubs.
During the next three days, the topic was a major
one discussed at the Cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>The Cub leader reported Jacques&rsquo; disappearance
to police, but was informed that no boy of his description
had been reported missing.</p>
<p>At first, the Cubs spent many hours trying to decipher
the coded message which Dan and Brad had
removed from Jacques&rsquo; clothing.</p>
<p>Failing to figure it out or to hear more of the boy,
the matter began to fade into the background. Only
Dan remained determined to work out the code.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Cubs turned their attention to an
important swimming meet which had been scheduled
with the boys of Den 1.</p>
<p>In a meet held the month before, the rival Den
had captured top honors by a score of 20 to 16.
Defeat rankled in the hearts of the Den 2 Cubs who
were determined to make a better showing in the
second contest.</p>
<p>A total of three meets had been scheduled for the
season. An engraved silver loving cup would be
awarded to the Den which won two of the contests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Ross Langdon will win the Saturday
meet too,&rdquo; Dan remarked glumly one afternoon as
he practiced with the other Cubs at the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; pool.
&ldquo;That guy swims as if he&rsquo;s jet propelled!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>Although Den 1 boasted several fine swimmers,
11-year-old Ross was by far the greatest threat to
the rival Cubs. Muscularly built, the boy had the
energy of a youngster of fifteen. His crawl stroke
lacked form, but by sheer strength he managed to
win every race he entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You swim as well as Ross does,&rdquo; Brad told Dan
loyally. &ldquo;Your form is better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Dan admitted, &ldquo;but I lack his endurance.
I hold out fairly well in the 25-yard free style,
but in the 50, I began to lose my wind. And you
know we&rsquo;ve got to capture both events to nose out
Den 1 in the final tally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know,&rdquo; Brad acknowledged, easing his
body snake-fashion down the pool wall into the
chlorinated water. &ldquo;Just get in and pitch, old boy.
Remember, the Den is counting on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes me worried, Brad. I want to
do my best. I practice and practice, but where does
it get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam Hatfield emerged from the dressing room in
time to hear Dan&rsquo;s final remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just keep plugging and top speed will come,
Dan,&rdquo; he said cheerfully. &ldquo;Stop worrying about Ross
Langdon. One of these days his lack of form will
catch up with him. Now dive into that pool and
swim eight lengths.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eight?&rdquo; Dan groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight,&rdquo; the Cub leader repeated firmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
only way you&rsquo;ll ever build up your endurance.
When the going gets hard&mdash;just keep going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspired by this advice, Dan dived into the water,
and with smooth strokes slashed his way the first
length of the pool.</p>
<p>After a turn at the wall, his breath became a little
short and he slowed down a little. By the end of
the third length, his stroke lost some of its hard
drive. At five lengths, his steady six-beat leg thrash
became a tired wiggle. Finally at the end of the
eighth length, Dan was holding out by sheer will
power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it up!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield called encouragingly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Ross Langdon sauntered into the
pool. Large for his age and a natural athlete, the
boy&rsquo;s appearances at the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; were few and far between,
for he disliked to practice. On this afternoon,
however, he had donned satin trunks, showered,
and evidently intended to swim.</p>
<p>Observing Dan&rsquo;s now jerky stroke, he uttered a
loud horse-laugh. Then to show off, he plunged into
the pool, and swam the length with a speed which
tossed foam ahead of his thrashing arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Thoroughly discouraged by the display, Dan
wheeled over to the side to watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; he muttered to Brad who slithered
alongside in the water. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t quite finish
eight lengths and here Ross blazes in and tears up
the pool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Dan,&rdquo; Brad encouraged him.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see him doing more than a few lengths
before he caves in. You just keep plugging the way
Mr. Hatfield said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the meet is Saturday. And look at that guy
travel! His form may not be so hot, but how he can
chop the water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well aware that the Cubs of Den 2 were watching,
Ross swam another length, finishing off with a
snappy turn at the wall.</p>
<p>Then he pulled himself from the pool, stretching
out on the tile floor to relax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, I told you!&rdquo; Brad muttered. &ldquo;As soon as the
going gets hard, he quits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To win the 25-yard and the 50-yard dash, he
won&rsquo;t need too much reserve,&rdquo; Dan sighed. &ldquo;Well,
I&rsquo;ll sure do my best to win, but I&rsquo;ve got a dark brown
feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>On Saturday, the day set for the swimming meet,
enthusiasm had mounted to high pitch. By two
o&rsquo;clock, all the Cubs, their parents and many other
spectators had gathered at the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; to witness the
contest.</p>
<p>Five events had been scheduled, fancy diving,
the 25-yard free style race, the 50-yard swim, a 100-yard
relay, and a back stroke event.</p>
<p>Points were to be awarded on the basis of five for
first place, three for second, and one for third place.
According to the rules, each team was allowed to
enter two contestants in an event.</p>
<p>Den 2 swung off to a good start with Brad taking
top honors and Midge Holloway coming in third.
This lead of six to three brought enthusiastic cheers
from the gallery.</p>
<p>The second event, the racing back crawl, proved
discouraging to Den 2. Though Chips Davis swam
an excellent race, he lost to one of the Den 1 boys.
Den 2, however, managed to snare both second and
third places, giving them a total score of 10 to 8.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From now on it will be nip and tuck,&rdquo; Brad said
grimly as the 25-yard free style was called. &ldquo;So far
Ross Langdon hasn&rsquo;t had a chance to swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the crack of the gun, Dan and Ross hit the
water together. From that first moment of the race
it was evident to the spectators that the remainder
of the meet would resolve itself into a battle between
the two swimmers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Though Dan exerted his best efforts, Ross won
the event by an easy six-foot margin. Dan was
awarded second place, while another swimmer from
Den 1 captured third position. The scoreboard proclaimed
the discouraging totals: Den 1&mdash;14. Den
2&mdash;13.</p>
<p>Only two events remained, the 50-yard free style
and the 100-yard relay. However, Ross was entered
in both events and the Cubs knew his flashy speed
could be counted upon to win for his den.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boy is in top form today&mdash;if you can say
he has any form,&rdquo; Midge muttered, slapping Dan
encouragingly on the back. &ldquo;Well, get in there and
show him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sure,&rdquo; Dan laughed, but his words had a
hollow ring.</p>
<p>As the Cubs of Den 2 expected, their rivals walked
away with the relay by a score of 20 to 16.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fat chance we have of winning now,&rdquo; Dan said
as the final event of the meet was called. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d
have to make a complete sweep, and we&rsquo;ll be lucky
to capture one place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It sure looks bad for Den 2,&rdquo; Brad agreed. &ldquo;But
get in there and fight, boy! Ross acts a bit winded.
He may not hold out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the 50-yard free style, the Cubs were required
to swim two lengths of the pool. Before the start of
the race, an official reminded the boys that they
must remain in their lanes and touch the wall at the
turn or be disqualified.</p>
<p>At the crack of the gun Ross and Dan were off
to a fast start, followed by the field of slower
swimmers.</p>
<p>As Brad had observed, Ross seemed somewhat
tired from his earlier performances. His stroke
looked ragged and jerky. Dan by contrast forged
smoothly ahead, pressing him hard every inch of
the way.</p>
<p>At the turn, the two rivals were racing almost
even. Determined to gain the lead, Ross lunged for
the wall, his finger tips missing it by a scant margin.
So rapidly did he turn, that few noticed.</p>
<p>Dan, tucking into a tight ball, also made a fast
turn, but touched the wall. His shove-off however,
was weak. When his head came out of water for a
gulp of air, he was disconcerted to see that Ross
was a full body length ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Dan!&rdquo; his teammates yelled encouragingly.
&ldquo;You can do it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Dan dug in, but his breath was coming hard. Despite
his best efforts he could not recapture the lead.
In a moment, it seemed, the race was over. Ross
had touched the finish wall a scant arm&rsquo;s length
ahead, and was congratulated as the winner.</p>
<p>For the members of Den 2 it was slight consolation
that Mack had won third place, nosing out a
Den 1 swimmer. The scoreboard proclaimed Den 1
the victor by a total of 25 to 20.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations, Ross,&rdquo; Dan said, offering his
hand. &ldquo;You swam a fine race!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; the other boy grinned. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t so
bad yourself. Pressed me plenty at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other members of Den 1 had gathered in a little
group. After talking rather excitedly, they called
Ross over. The other Cubs could not hear what was
said, but they gathered that Ross himself was the
topic of conversation. Apparently, he disagreed with
his teammates about some matter, for his voice rose
in sharp protest.</p>
<p>Then the Cubs heard him say sullenly: &ldquo;Okay,
if you want to be saps, go ahead! It makes me sick,
after the way I worked to win for the team!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ross&rsquo; teammates talked to their coach briefly.
Then before the audience or Den 2 swimmers could
leave the pool, a whistle blasted for attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, we regret that an error
has been made in scoring,&rdquo; an official announced.
&ldquo;It has been brought to notice that one of the contestants,
Ross Langdon, failed to touch the wall at
the end of the first length.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A buzz of conversation greeted this announcement.
Brad and Dan glanced quickly at each other,
and then at Ross. The face of the latter was as black
as a summer rainstorm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Due to this infraction of the rules, Ross has been
disqualified,&rdquo; the official continued. &ldquo;Dan Carter
wins first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A mighty cheer rocked the pool gallery. Even
heavier applause broke out as new figures went up
on the scoreboard:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Den 2&mdash;24 <span class="hst">Den 1&mdash;21.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Brad and the other Den 2 teammates swarmed
about Dan, clapping him on his dripping shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, you did it!&rdquo; Red Suell congratulated him.
&ldquo;Now the matches are even! If we win the third
meet, that silver cup is in the bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;IF is right,&rdquo; Dan laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, this
victory was a fluke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Mr. Hatfield, the Cubs learned that only
the good sportsmanship of the Den 1 teammates
had been responsible for their success. Ross himself
had made no mention of his failure to touch the
wall, and his error had gone unnoticed by officials.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two of Den 1 swimmers saw Ross miss the
turn,&rdquo; the Cub leader revealed. &ldquo;They reasoned that
honor means more than victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Cub Always is Square,&rdquo; Dan quoted thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud
of our boys for winning, but equally proud of the
other team for reporting the incident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The swimmers of Den 1 gathered around to congratulate
Dan and his teammates. Ross, however,
had slipped away to the dressing room without a
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a little sore,&rdquo; one of his teammates remarked.
&ldquo;But he&rsquo;ll get over it. The coach warned
Ross plenty of times to be careful about that turn.
He never paid much attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling on top of the world, Dan showered and
dressed. As he was getting his things from the locker,
he bumped squarely into Ross.</p>
<p>Dan waited a moment, expecting the other boy
to offer some word of congratulation. When Ross
said nothing, he remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had a tough break, fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Ross gave a snort of disgust. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it was a
tough break,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;In a straight race, you
couldn&rsquo;t win and we both know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remark annoyed Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;My stroke is
improving every day. I noticed you were pretty well
winded at the finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bunk. I didn&rsquo;t even exert myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, now that the two teams are tied, it will
make a good meet when the final contest is scheduled,&rdquo;
Dan said, trying to ease out of a disagreeable
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Ross said, his eyes flashing. &ldquo;Maybe you
can dig up another technical point and win the
cup! You&rsquo;ll never earn it on merit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that challenge, he brushed past Dan
and slouched out of the dressing room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER 5</span>
<br />Paper Bag Eddie</h2>
<p>Stung by Ross&rsquo; jibe, Dan spent much of his time
the next few days at the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; pool. To build endurance
and smooth out his stroke, he also swam in
the river. Always on these occasions he was accompanied
by Brad or Midge&rsquo;s father in a boat.</p>
<p>Now that the swimming meet was over, the other
Cubs temporarily turned their attention to various
Den activities. Brad tried to assist Dan in deciphering
the code message which had been found in
Jacques&rsquo; pocket.</p>
<p>However, after three days of work, he gave up
in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it isn&rsquo;t a code after all,&rdquo; he said, returning
the paper to Dan. &ldquo;I figure those numerals must
stand for letters that spell out a message. But I can&rsquo;t
get the hang of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll keep on trying,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;Not that
it will mean much if we do puzzle out the thing.
Jacques is gone, and probably we&rsquo;ll never see him
again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what became of that kid anyhow?&rdquo; Brad
mused. &ldquo;It sure was funny, finding him on the beach
the way we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he never told us his name or explained anything.
I&rsquo;d say there was every indication someone
came and took him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield made inquiries,&rdquo; Brad added. &ldquo;No
one saw the boy leave the Cave. He&rsquo;s unknown in
Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Dan and the other Cubs had kept a
close watch of the waterfront, they had sighted no
boat which resembled the one that had damaged
Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s craft. Therefore, the conviction
steadily grew that Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s speedboat might
be the one involved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Manheim is well spoken of at the club,&rdquo;
Midge&rsquo;s father told the boys. &ldquo;It would be a serious
mistake if we made any accusation against him or
any of his employees. The boat has been repaired,
and as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, the matter will be
dropped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Midge said no more about the affair, but
in private they often remarked that they thought
Wilson Jabowski, the caretaker on Skeleton Island,
would bear investigation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hear he hasn&rsquo;t worked very long for Mr. Manheim,&rdquo;
Dan remarked. &ldquo;And folks say that when his
employer is out of town, he rides around in that
speedboat like a king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe if we keep our eyes open we&rsquo;ll catch up
with him yet,&rdquo; Midge said. &ldquo;He may crack into
another boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the regular Friday night meeting of the Den,
the Cubs enjoyed the beach treasure hunt which
had been interrupted at the previous gathering.
Mack and Fred came off victorious, their clues leading
them to the buried chest which contained carpenter&rsquo;s
tools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Den needs a bookcase,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield reminded
the pair as they admired their &lsquo;find&rsquo;. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
expect you boys to produce something handsome
now that you have the tools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it too,&rdquo; Mack promised.</p>
<p>With the treasure hunt over, all the Cubs gathered
on the beach for a council fire and &ldquo;feed.&rdquo; Mrs.
Holloway passed out hot dog sandwiches, chocolate
and thick wedges of pie.</p>
<p>When the boys could eat no more, they stretched
out on the sand, and begged Mr. Hatfield to tell
them a ghost story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might tell you about the ghost of Skeleton
Island,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A true story?&rdquo; Dan demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may have elements of truth,&rdquo; the Cub leader
replied. &ldquo;Basically though, the tale is a product of
the imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;re making up the story?&rdquo; Midge
asked in disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Cub leader corrected. &ldquo;I first heard
about Skeleton Island as a boy. According to the
tale, it once was an old pirate stronghold. River
pirates would come upstream and hide their loot
on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was any of it ever dug up?&rdquo; Midge demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I ever heard. But thirty years ago, a
man&rsquo;s skeleton was found on the island. That&rsquo;s how
the place received its name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the ghost?&rdquo; Dan inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that part. The old freebooters supposedly
built a tunnel which connected some point
of the beach with an old inn that was on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the hotel that&rsquo;s there now?&rdquo; Brad interposed.
&ldquo;I mean the abandoned one that Mr. Manheim
converted into the caretaker&rsquo;s premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it is the same place, Brad. However,
I believe that after the old inn burned down, the
present building was erected in its place. That was
at least fifty years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the ghost?&rdquo; Red Suell reminded him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost? Oh, yes, to be sure. The fellow, I&rsquo;m
told, never was very active. On windy nights, shore
residents reported seeing a white, misty figure moving
along the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mist&mdash;that&rsquo;s probably what it was,&rdquo; Brad said
with a snort. &ldquo;Anyone knows there are no ghosts.
I&rsquo;m more interested in that tunnel. Do you think one
actually was built, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to think that part of the story is
true, Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what became of the tunnel? No one has
heard of it in recent years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was asking an old timer about that only yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he tell you?&rdquo; Dan demanded,
eager for additional details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This old salt claimed that heavy wind storms
blocked off the beach entrance to the tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t it be relocated and dug out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably, if anyone wanted to go to that much
work. It would be a big job shifting so much sand
even if the entranceway could be found. I don&rsquo;t
suppose Mr. Manheim ever was interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He owns the entire island, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Brad
asked thoughtfully. Picking up a piece of driftwood,
he fed it to the dying embers of the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the Cub leader agreed. &ldquo;The Scouts
have been dickering with him for nearly six months
to purchase a stretch of beach for their permanent
camp. They&rsquo;re also considering a site two miles
farther down river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which will they take?&rdquo; Chips asked. &ldquo;I should
think Skeleton Island would be better, because it&rsquo;s
closer to Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far, Mr. Manheim has asked a fairly steep
price and doesn&rsquo;t seem inclined to come down,&rdquo; the
Cub leader replied. &ldquo;The Scout director has made
two inspection trips and is well satisfied. Now he
wants me to make my recommendation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said the Cubs might go there on an over-night
camping trip,&rdquo; Red reminded him.</p>
<p>All the Cubs waited expectantly for the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if plans work out, we&rsquo;ll make it next weekend,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield answered. &ldquo;The Den fathers are
planning the trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs began to talk about the proposed excursion,
discussing what they would take with them
to camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll see the ghost of Skeleton Island
while we&rsquo;re there!&rdquo; Chips declared hopefully. &ldquo;Or
find the entrance to the old tunnel!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>The Cub meeting broke up shortly after nine
o&rsquo;clock. Dan and Brad remained a few minutes after
the others had gone to make certain that the last
embers of the beach fire had been extinguished.</p>
<p>Then together, they started home, selecting a
route which took them along the deserted waterfront.</p>
<p>At Clinton Street, the boys turned at the corner,
passing a cafe from which issued the discordant
notes of a player piano.</p>
<p>On the curb outside the restaurant stood a short
little man, who was munching popcorn from a paper
bag. His face was sharp and weasel-like, his eyes
darting and shrewd.</p>
<p>The Cubs might have passed him with scarcely a
second glance, had he not been talking to another
man who looked faintly familiar to Dan. The fellow
plainly was a sailor, dark of hair and with sturdy
body build.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow looks like one of the men who were
in the motorboat that struck the Holloway sailboat!&rdquo;
Dan said in an undertone to Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the little one with the paper bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the other. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve seen him somewhere.
Let&rsquo;s watch for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Sliding into a shadowy doorway, Brad and Dan
kept their eyes on the pair. However, they were
too far away to hear the conversation. A newsboy
noticed their interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know those guys?&rdquo; he asked, sidling up to them.</p>
<p>Dan shook his head, hoping that the boy would
move on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that guy with the paper sack,&rdquo; the lad continued,
eager to impart information. &ldquo;Know who
he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one they call &lsquo;Paper Bag Eddie,&rsquo;&rdquo; the
boy said, awe in his voice. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bad one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paper Bag Eddie?&rdquo; Dan repeated, keeping his
voice low. &ldquo;Never heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never heard of Paper Bag Eddie? Why, he&rsquo;s
known to every cop in town, but they never get
much on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a crook then?&rdquo; Brad interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, they say he&rsquo;s the brains of a waterfront
gang. Guess what he carries around in those paper
bags of his&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Popcorn,&rdquo; said Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess again. He packs a revolver. Eddie loafs
around the waterfront and you hardly ever see him
without his little paper bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think the police would pick him up for
carrying a concealed weapon,&rdquo; Brad said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Eddie ain&rsquo;t dumb enough to go around with
the revolver all the time. Mostly you&rsquo;ll see him
munching peanuts or popcorn, and if the cops search
him that&rsquo;s what they find. But if he pulls a job, he
slips the revolver into the sack. The cops figure he
only has a bag of popcorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie never has been arrested?&rdquo; Brad inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the cops run him in regular, but they&rsquo;ve
never dug up enough evidence to convict him.
Eddie&rsquo;s a slick one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is his companion?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw him before,&rdquo; the newsboy said indifferently.
&ldquo;Some sailor, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently aware that they were under scrutiny,
Paper Bag Eddie and his company glanced briefly
at the Cubs and sauntered on down the street. A few
doors farther on they entered the Green Parrot Cafe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get on home,&rdquo; Brad urged.</p>
<p>Dan, however, had another idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad, I&rsquo;m dead certain that sailor with Paper
Bag Eddie is the one who was operating the motorboat
when it crashed into Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s sailboat,&rdquo;
he insisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try to pin it on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And end up in plenty of trouble. You know Mr.
Holloway advised that the entire matter be
dropped.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know. But that was mostly because Mr.
Manheim is well known at the club. I have a hunch
he didn&rsquo;t know anything about the boat accident.
And it may not have been his speed craft either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, I say we&rsquo;re asking for trouble if we try
striking up an acquaintance with that pair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to speak to them,&rdquo; Dan argued.
&ldquo;Why not follow them into the cafe and take a table
nearby? We might hear something interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-e-ll,&rdquo; Brad hesitated, &ldquo;I suppose it wouldn&rsquo;t
do any harm. Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling somewhat ill at ease, the two boys entered
the Green Parrot. The room was dingy and dimly
lighted, its plaster walls streaked with smoke. Only
a few customers were visible.</p>
<p>Brad and Dan slipped into a booth diagonally opposite
a table where Paper Bag Eddie and his companion
sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know your orders, Frisk,&rdquo; they heard the
one with the weasel-like face say. &ldquo;When you get
the signal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off as his gaze fastened upon Dan and
Brad. The Cubs instantly looked away but Paper
Bag Eddie&rsquo;s suspicions had been aroused.</p>
<p>Shoving back his chair, he walked over to the
booth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; he demanded in a soft,
purring voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; Brad returned,
meeting his gaze steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You followed me in here. Now you&rsquo;re trying to
eavesdrop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a free country,&rdquo; Brad retorted. &ldquo;If my
friend and I want to come in here for a sandwich,
I&rsquo;d like to see you stop us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would, eh?&rdquo; the man replied, his lips parting
in an ugly smile. He grasped Brad by the shoulder,
pulling him half-way out of the booth. &ldquo;Who are
you and what&rsquo;s your game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Brad could answer, the proprietor of the
Green Parrot came quickly from the direction of the
kitchen. He had seen what was happening and did
not want any trouble in his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out, Eddie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No rough stuff
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are these kids?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know? Never saw &rsquo;em before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were standing outside the cafe, watching,&rdquo;
Eddie informed the proprietor. &ldquo;When we came in,
they followed. I say, throw &rsquo;em out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proprietor hesitated, reluctant to antagonize
either party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Throw &rsquo;em out!&rdquo; Paper Bag Eddie repeated in a
tone not to be denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, boys,&rdquo; the proprietor apologized. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want any trouble here. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to
ask you to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;Come on, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In sliding out from the booth seat, Dan bestowed
another glance upon the man Paper Bag Eddie had
called &ldquo;Frisk.&rdquo; More than ever he was convinced
that he had not been mistaken in identifying him as
the motorboat operator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you before,&rdquo; he said, halting beside the
table. &ldquo;You were handling the wheel of the motorboat
that struck our dinghy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; the florid-faced man rasped. &ldquo;I
never set eyes on either of you before&mdash;and what&rsquo;s
more, I don&rsquo;t want to again. Now if you know what&rsquo;s
healthy, get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan would have stood his ground, but Brad
grasped his arm, pulling him firmly along. The proprietor
followed the two boys to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he apologized once more. Then in an
undertone, he added: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come back. For some
reason Eddie has taken a dislike to you&mdash;and when
he&rsquo;s crossed, he&rsquo;s bad medicine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER 6</span>
<br />Stranded</h2>
<p>Three days elapsed during which Brad, Dan and
the other Cubs spent much time at the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; and at the
river practicing for the final swimming meet of the
year with Den 1.</p>
<p>Annoyed by the manner in which they had been
treated by Paper Bag Eddie and his friend &ldquo;Frisk,&rdquo;
the two Cubs interested themselves in making a few
inquiries along the waterfront.</p>
<p>They learned that a sailor by the last name of
Fagan frequently was seen with Eddie. Although
known to have no employment, he was reported always
with enough money in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m as sure as anything Fagan was in the motorboat
that struck us,&rdquo; Dan repeated to Brad one afternoon
when the two boys were at the river preparing
for a swim. &ldquo;I suspect that was why he acted so sore
in the cafe. He was afraid we&rsquo;d accuse him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since their meeting with Paper Bag Eddie and the
sailor, the two Cubs had not seen either of them
again. Nor had they glimpsed Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s boat
or any that resembled it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>On this particular afternoon, Mr. Holloway had
promised to take Brad, Dan and Midge for a sail.
Four o&rsquo;clock, the hour appointed for their meeting
at the Yacht Club dock, came and went. Finally, Mr.
Holloway telephoned from his office to say that he
had been held up and would be unable to make the
excursion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why you boys can&rsquo;t take the
boat by yourselves,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re both experienced
at handling the tiller, and good swimmers. Go
ahead! Only don&rsquo;t go too far from the Yacht Club.
A storm could kick up before dusk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortifying themselves with bottles of pop, Dan
and Brad hoisted sail and cast off. With Brad at the
tiller, they sailed down the channel, past Fish Island,
and on toward Skeleton Island. They had been
anxious to explore this island for some time.</p>
<p>Dan lounged in the bottom of the boat, lazily sipping
his drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sail all the way around Skeleton Island,&rdquo; he
proposed. &ldquo;Okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, if we have time,&rdquo; Brad agreed, glancing at
the darkening sky. &ldquo;Those clouds are rolling up
rather fast though. We might have rain in a couple
of hours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it back before then,&rdquo; Dan replied,
stretching luxuriously. &ldquo;The breeze is just right
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a long tack, they crossed to the far shore of the
river and came about, pointing toward Skeleton
Island.</p>
<p>As Dan dropped an empty pop bottle overboard,
he noticed a mahogany motorboat almost directly
opposite the island.</p>
<p>The craft had pulled up along shore, its motor
idle. The boy was unable to see the occupants or to
obtain a clear view of the boat itself, for it lay half-hidden
in a clump of bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boat looks a little like Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he
remarked, calling Brad&rsquo;s attention to it. &ldquo;Wonder
what it&rsquo;s doing over there? No one appears to be
fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holding the sailboat to its course, the two Cubs
kept watch of the idle motorboat. Though they were
too far away to be certain the craft was Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s,
they thought it bore a marked resemblance
to the craft operated by Wilson Jabowski.</p>
<p>Presently, as the boys watched, they saw someone
aboard the motorboat lower and raise a red flag
three times in succession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea of that?&rdquo; Dan demanded, all
attention. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re signaling!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To someone on Skeleton Island,&rdquo; Brad added
quietly.</p>
<p>Dan turned his gaze toward the island beach. A
man stood there, apparently focusing his attention
upon the motorboat. In answer to the signal, he
raised and lowered his arm three times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What goes?&rdquo; Brad muttered.</p>
<p>For awhile, the Cubs witnessed nothing more of
interest. The man on the beach vanished from their
range of vision, while the motorboat remained in
the clump of bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess there&rsquo;s nothing more to see,&rdquo; Dan remarked
in disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is!&rdquo; Brad corrected, bringing the sailboat
closer into the wind. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys distinctly could hear the putt-putt-putt
of a gasoline engine. For a minute they could
not localize the sound. Then, from the far shoulder
of the island, they saw a flat gasoline-propelled raft
scooting across the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks like Jabowski,&rdquo; Dan observed. &ldquo;And
he&rsquo;s heading straight toward the motorboat! Can we
get closer, Brad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless the breeze shifts it will take us two or three
tacks to come even with the island.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And by that time, there may be nothing to see,&rdquo;
Dan grumbled. &ldquo;I sure wish we had a pair of binoculars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dividing their attention between pressing more
speed out of their own craft, and watching the raft,
the boys begrudged the time it took to make the
long tack.</p>
<p>The raft, they noted, moved directly to the waiting
motorboat. What transpired at the meeting place,
they were unable to see.</p>
<p>So intent were the Cubs on watching the boat and
raft, that they paid scant heed to the low cumulus
clouds which had gathered close to the horizon.</p>
<p>Black underneath and hard-edged, they were moving
up fast from the leeward!</p>
<p>The Cubs, however, were elated because a stiffening
breeze rapidly bore them toward Skeleton
Island. Now they could discern two men aboard the
motorboat. Though they could not see the face of
the man on the raft, they were convinced he was
Jabowski.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you figure they&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; Dan speculated.
&ldquo;And who are those men that have Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s
speedboat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it isn&rsquo;t his,&rdquo; Brad replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s the
same length and make though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Apparently observing the approach of the sailboat,
the raft began to pull away from the motor
craft.</p>
<p>At that same moment, a dead calm fell upon the
river. Startled, Brad raised his eye to the sail which
had been drawing well. Now it had slumped into listless,
discouraged folds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just our luck!&rdquo; Dan muttered in disgust. &ldquo;The
breeze plays out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than that,&rdquo; Brad said, thoroughly
alarmed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the calm that precedes a bad
thunderstorm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both the sky and the water had taken on a dark
cast. Although not a breath of air stirred, heavy
waves pounded against the drifting boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, we&rsquo;re a long ways from shore too!&rdquo; Dan
said in dismay. &ldquo;Skeleton Island is the closest point
of land. Think we can make it before the storm
breaks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; Brad muttered. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Across the water they could see a misty sheet of
water descending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be wind in a minute! Plenty of it! Dan!
Help me get the sail down before it strikes us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Working with all speed, the boys lowered the sail
from the mast. Before they could furl it, the wind
struck, throwing the boat far over on its side.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s Cub cap was lifted from his head, and carried
far down river. For a moment it floated on the
surface, and then slowly sank out of sight.</p>
<p>Dan scrambled to fasten down all other loose objects.
Rain now was coming down in a torrent. Unable
to see many feet ahead of them, the boys lost
sight of the raft and the motorboat. For a time they
could hear the chug-chug of the raft&rsquo;s engine, and
then all sound except the howl of the wind died
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is awful!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed as a vivid streak
of lightning cut across the dark sky. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s strike for
Skeleton Island. We can find shelter there, at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached for the paddle. Already the strong
wind was propelling the boat in the general direction
of the island.</p>
<p>At the tiller, Brad guided the craft more by instinct
than sight. Wind and rain had blotted out all view
of the shore.</p>
<p>Finally, the shadowy island loomed up. Worn out
from hard paddling, Dan put on a last burst of
energy which drove the boat onto the sandy beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Leaping out, he and Brad pulled the craft high up
on the sand beyond reach of the waves. Then they
raced for the shelter of a heavily wooded section
some distance back from the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jabowski lives in the caretaker&rsquo;s quarters at the
other end of the island,&rdquo; Brad remarked, huddling
against the trunk of a sheltering oak. &ldquo;We might go
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather wait here, Brad. This storm shouldn&rsquo;t
last long. Then we can hoist canvas and sail back to
the clubhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already the rain had slackened. The Cubs waited
twenty minutes under the trees. By that time the
downpour had dwindled to a drizzle. Then they
made their way back through the dripping bushes to
the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Where&rsquo;s our boat?&rdquo; Dan demanded, stopping
short.</p>
<p>The stretch of beach where the craft had been
left less than thirty minutes before, now was deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the boat can&rsquo;t be gone!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed, refusing
to believe his eyes. &ldquo;We pulled it well up on
the sand before we took shelter! The waves weren&rsquo;t
high enough to have washed it away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s gone all right. And there it is, Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Dan pointed two hundred yards from shore where
the empty sailboat drifted aimlessly. Slowly the craft
was being carried downstream by the current.</p>
<p>The Cubs stared at it in stunned dismay. Without
the sailboat, they were stranded on Skeleton Island!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER 7</span>
<br />Camp Site</h2>
<p>The Cubs stood a long while, silently viewing the
drifting boat. No other craft now was visible on the
river, and no one appeared aware of their plight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I could swim out there before the boat
moves farther downstream,&rdquo; Dan proposed, estimating
the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life!&rdquo; Brad promptly vetoed the suggestion.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an expert swimmer and might make
it, but we&rsquo;re taking no chances. We&rsquo;ve already
messed things up enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holloway warned us a storm might blow up,&rdquo;
Dan added, kicking disgustedly at the wet sand.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have been more alert if we hadn&rsquo;t been so
interested in that raft and motorboat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holloway just had his boat repaired too. Now
if it sinks or rams into something, we have no one to
blame except ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s gaze had focused upon a man&rsquo;s large footprint
visible in the sand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say! Maybe we do have someone else to blame
besides ourselves!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad stared at the footprint which plainly had
been made since the Cubs had pulled their boat up
on shore. Half-protected from the rain by a piece of
driftwood, it remained the only mark on an otherwise
smooth beachway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s been here since we were!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
stooping to examine the shoe print.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that someone must have set our boat free
to drift, Brad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jabowski?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be, Brad. He took a dislike to me, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, it would be a contemptible trick. I hate
to think he&rsquo;d do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else is on the island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one so far as I know,&rdquo; Brad replied, his eyes
troubled. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a relief to know the boat didn&rsquo;t
drift off due to our own carelessness. Even so, we&rsquo;re
in a jam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan nodded, his face sober. The afternoon had
grown dark and night would come on earlier than
usual. When the sailboat failed to return to the clubhouse,
he knew Mr. Holloway would be very
worried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be picked up eventually,&rdquo; he said, shivering
in his wet clothing. &ldquo;Meanwhile, we&rsquo;re in for an
uncomfortable time of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find Jabowski&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; Brad proposed. &ldquo;He
might be willing to pick up our boat with his raft, or
at least take us ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think he&rsquo;d do it? After the way he set our boat
loose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may suspect he did it, but it could have been
someone else, Dan. Anyway, isn&rsquo;t it better than
standing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Dan agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our only chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the beach, the boys could see no buildings
on the island. However, from previous sails in the
locality, they knew that the old hotel building was
situated in a heavily wooded section to the north.</p>
<p>Setting off diagonally through a thicket of saplings,
they found a trail which led in the direction
they wished to go. After wading through a patch of
weeds and rushes which came to waist-depth, they
emerged into an area of thin green turf.</p>
<p>Beyond they spied the old hotel, a sprawling
building with grimy windows and broken shutters.
Unpainted in recent years, it had a look of utter
abandonment. The foundation had crumbled in
many places and the roof sagged. Broken window
panes in the upper story windows had not been
replaced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the place is deserted,&rdquo; Dan said in disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why is smoke coming from the chimney?&rdquo;
Brad demanded. Trained as a Scout to be observing,
he had noticed the blue-white wisp curling from the
rear of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. Someone must be there now. Let&rsquo;s
knock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pushed on, circling the old building. Brad
rapped on the rear door. There was no answer.</p>
<p>He pounded. Still no one came to the door. Glancing
upward, however, Dan fancied he saw a face at
a dirt-streaked window almost directly overhead.
Before he could be sure, the shadow was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; Brad said, after rapping again on the
door. &ldquo;Someone must be living here, but the place
seems to be deserted now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either that, or Jabowski&rsquo;s hiding out. I thought
I saw a face at the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger boy indicated the window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one there now,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;But I think you
may be right. Ever since we came here, I&rsquo;ve had a
feeling as if we&rsquo;re being watched. There&rsquo;s something
about this place I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Convinced they were to obtain no help from the
caretaker, the boys sought an easier route back to
the beach.</p>
<p>Not far from the rear of the hotel, they noticed an
abandoned pier which had fallen into decay. Tied to
it was the same raft they had observed earlier that
afternoon.</p>
<p>Farther down the shore extended a long stretch of
loose sand which gradually merged into turf and
wooded area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if that tale Mr. Hatfield told us about
the tunnel is true?&rdquo; Brad speculated as they
dog-trotted along. &ldquo;No evidence of it anywhere
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without seeing anyone, the boys struck across the
dunes, and finally emerged on the beach not far
from where they first had taken refuge.</p>
<p>Gazing down-river, they sought to determine the
position of their drifting boat. To their astonishment
it was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for crying out loud!&rdquo; Dan yipped. &ldquo;Now
what became of it? How could that boat have drifted
out of sight so fast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t. Either someone has hauled it in or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Or what?&rdquo; Dan demanded as his companion
broke off.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Brad pointed far upstream.
The missing sailboat had been taken in tow by a
motor launch from the Yacht Club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes our boat now, Dan! And with it our
chance for a rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s yell. Maybe we can attract attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In unison, the boys shouted and waved their arms.
Running far down the beach, they watched the receding
launch anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They see us!&rdquo; Brad cried in relief. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s turning
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True to his observation, the motor craft had come
about. With the sailboat still in tow, it set a direct
course for the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky break for us,&rdquo; Brad mumbled in relief. &ldquo;I
had visions of spending the night on this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within a few minutes the launch came close to the
island. Brad and Dan saw then that Mr. Hatfield was
at the wheel, accompanied by Midge, Red and
Chips. The owner of the launch, a man they did not
know, also was in the boat.</p>
<p>The Cub leader eased the craft as near shore as he
could. When the launch could approach no closer
without grounding, he advised Brad and Dan to
wade out. Eager hands pulled them over the side
into the launch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been worried about you,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said, wrapping his coat about Dan. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Midge&rsquo;s
father warn you to remain close to the clubhouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, sir. We meant to carry out his orders. But
a lot happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll discuss that later, Dan. The important thing
is that you&rsquo;re both safe. By the way, meet Mr.
Fisher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad grasped the launch owner&rsquo;s horny
hand, expressing gratitude for the rescue. From him
they learned that their drifting boat had been sighted
by Midge from the Cave. The Cub had summoned
Mr. Hatfield, who had sought the help of Mr. Fisher
in finding them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Brad scared us out of a year&rsquo;s growth,&rdquo;
Chips said accusingly. &ldquo;Seeing that empty boat made
us think you might have drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me drown?&rdquo; Dan snorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be a crack swimmer, but accidents do
occur,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield interposed. &ldquo;Suppose you tell
us what happened that caused you to sail so far
from the clubhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together Dan and Brad explained how their attention
had been drawn to the raft and motorboat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The storm struck us unexpectedly,&rdquo; Brad added.
&ldquo;We barely had time to get the sail down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you managed that,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield approved.
&ldquo;The wind didn&rsquo;t last long but it was strong
when it came. If it had hit you with the sail up, the
dinghy probably would have capsized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made Skeleton Island,&rdquo; Dan took up the account.
&ldquo;After beaching the boat, we dashed back
into the bushes to get out of the rain. When we returned
to the beach, our boat was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dan,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield sighed. &ldquo;How many times
have I warned the Cubs always to pull a boat
beyond reach of the waves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we did, sir! Someone deliberately set the
dinghy loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield braced himself as the launch swung
sharply around a buoy which marked a river
shoal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your boat was set loose?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Are you
sure, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we found a man&rsquo;s footprint in the sand.
That boat couldn&rsquo;t have broken away by itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have an idea who did it,&rdquo; Brad added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s mention no names,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said
quickly. &ldquo;That is, not unless you&rsquo;re certain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Being unable to prove that it was Jabowski who
had shoved their boat from the beach, Dan and Brad
remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you believe you were careful about the
boat,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;Perhaps you were. On the
other hand, you might have been mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; commented Brad in quick protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear in mind that Mr. Manheim, the island
owner, has been very friendly to the Scouts and Cubs.
He&rsquo;s given permission for us to camp on Skeleton
Island this weekend. Now if wild accusations should
reach his ears, it might prove embarrassing to say
the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan grasped the idea Mr. Hatfield intended
to convey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, maybe we were mistaken,&rdquo; Brad
grinned. &ldquo;Those waves were pretty big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No more was said about the sailboat mishap at
that time. But later at the Cave, the two boys told
Mr. Hatfield why they had been so interested in the
raft operator&rsquo;s contact with the motorboat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed queer the men in the motorboat would
signal,&rdquo; Dan remarked. &ldquo;We figured it must have
been Jabowski who ferried across the river to
meet them. No one else appears to be living on the
island.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know more about Skeleton Island after this
weekend,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield remarked. &ldquo;The camping
trip should give us an opportunity to see that everything
is satisfactory before the property is purchased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think something queer may be going
on there?&rdquo; Brad demanded alertly.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield smiled and did not answer the question
directly. &ldquo;Oh, one can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;No use
exciting the Cubs in any case. So not a word of this
to the other boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the remainder of the week, preparations
for the camping trip kept Dan and Brad so busy they
had little time to think of possible mystery at Skeleton
Island.</p>
<p>However, unknown to them, Mr. Hatfield was
more disturbed by the sailboat incident than he
cared to admit.</p>
<p>On two occasions he telephoned Mr. Manheim,
intending to inquire as to any possible intruders on
Skeleton Island.</p>
<p>He was informed that the island owner was out
of the city and would not return before Saturday.</p>
<p>Though Brad and Dan were careful to say nothing
of their unfortunate experience on Skeleton Island,
the other Cubs guessed that there was more to the
story than had been told.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on&mdash;give,&rdquo; Midge urged. &ldquo;I know you boys
are too smart to let a boat get away from you, even
in a storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to report,&rdquo; Dan replied with a wide
grin.</p>
<p>His silence only made the Cubs more curious.
They discussed the proposed camping trip at great
length, building up elements of mystery and adventure.
And to make their rivals, the Cubs of Den 1,
envious, they passed out hints that something queer
already had happened there.</p>
<p>In due time, these rumors reached the ears of Ross
Langdon.</p>
<p>Still smarting from his defeat in the swimming
meet, he told his buddies that he intended to have a
little wholesome fun at Dan Carter&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just be sure it&rsquo;s fun and not revenge,&rdquo; a fellow
Cub warned him. &ldquo;Seems to me you&rsquo;ve been a sore-head
ever since you lost the race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who lost a race?&rdquo; Ross retorted. &ldquo;I wuz robbed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unaware that Ross was plotting revenge, Dan continued
to practice his swimming faithfully at the
&ldquo;Y&rdquo; pool.</p>
<p>Between times, he slaved on the coded message
left by Jacques. But try as he would, he could not
decipher it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When it comes to solving a puzzle, I&rsquo;m a dud,&rdquo;
Dan remarked one afternoon as he and Brad lounged
in the cave. &ldquo;And that reminds me&mdash;we&rsquo;ve heard
nothing more about Paper Bag Eddie or his friend
Fagan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, that fellow&rsquo;s hook-up with a man of
Eddie&rsquo;s shady reputation makes me wonder if he
could have had any part in the fur theft,&rdquo; Brad said
thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not seen a word in the paper lately
about any hauls by river pirates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither have I, Brad. That robbery was pulled
just about the time of night Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s boat was
hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been thinking, Dan. Why
not drop around and talk to Hank Hawkins? He
may have heard of this bird Fagan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having nothing more pressing to do, Dan agreed
to the proposal.</p>
<p>The boys found the warehouseman at the dock
chatting with his friend, Joe Matt. The seeing-eye
dog, upon sighting Dan, began to strain at his leash.
Only after the blindman had restrained the animal
were the Cubs able to enter the warehouse.</p>
<p>For awhile the conversation centered on river
commerce. Then presently, Dan and Brad steered it
to the topic of river pirates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish the police would get busy and catch these
pug-uglies that have been makin&rsquo; so much trouble
along the waterfront,&rdquo; Hank said irritably. &ldquo;Trouble
is, they&rsquo;re slick operators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you lost any shipments lately?&rdquo; Joe Matt
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since the furs were snatched. All the same,
I&rsquo;m keeping my fingers crossed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think the river pirates would strike
twice in the same area?&rdquo; the blindman scoffed.
&ldquo;Especially with police on the lookout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put anything past those boys!&rdquo; Hank
retorted as he studied a bill of lading. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking
no chances! Not with another valuable shipment due
any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another box of furs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming through around the 24th,&rdquo; the blindman
remarked casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That happens to be the date,&rdquo; Hank admitted,
gazing at the other rather sharply. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t remember
saying anything about it. Fact is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was a slip of the tongue,&rdquo; Hank replied.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do me a favor not to speak of the date. It&rsquo;s
confidential information.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Joe Matt apologized. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there
was any secret about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every precaution is being taken to safeguard the
shipment. Special police will guard the docks. I got
nothing to worry about&mdash;and yet I do it anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re jittery,&rdquo; the blindman said, starting away.
&ldquo;Well, see you later. Come on, Rudy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he had tapped off down the dock, Brad and
Dan lingered a few minutes longer. Hank, however,
seemed preoccupied. Dan asked him if he knew any
sailor by the name of Frisk Fagan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he answered a trifle irritably. &ldquo;Now
I wish you boys wouldn&rsquo;t pester me. I got work
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus dismissed, Brad and Dan took themselves
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hank was out of sorts because we overhead Joe
Matt mention that 24th shipping date,&rdquo; Dan remarked
as they tramped along together. &ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s
funny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two dates being the same!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What two dates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you recall?&rdquo; Dan demanded excitedly.
&ldquo;That coded message Jacques had in his pocket mentioned
the 24th!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The note included the numerals 24,&rdquo; Brad admitted.
&ldquo;But what does that prove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing perhaps. Then again, it may mean
plenty!&rdquo; Dan spoke with quiet conviction. &ldquo;I know
one thing. I&rsquo;m really going to work on that message.
I&rsquo;ll break the code if it&rsquo;s humanly possible!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER 8</span>
<br />&ldquo;Dan Carter&mdash;Take Warning&rdquo;</h2>
<p>On the night prior to the departure of Den 2 for
Skeleton Island, all the Cubs gathered at the Cave
to receive final instructions.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield informed the boys they were to meet
at the Webster City Yacht Club promptly at eight
o&rsquo;clock the next morning. Transportation would be
provided to the island in a launch contributed by a
friend of Midge&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t oversleep,&rdquo; he warned as the meeting
broke up. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t arrive at the dock before the
crack of dawn either! Try to make it about a quarter
to eight so we can leave on the hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After nearly all of the Cubs had gone, Mr. Hatfield
and Brad busied themselves straightening the
clubroom. Dan brought the record of the meeting
up to date. Then, pulling a chair up beside the gasoline
lamp, he reverted to his favorite occupation&mdash;that
of trying to solve the coded message left by
Jacques.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having any luck?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield presently inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo; Dan dropped his pencil in a gesture of
utter discouragement. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m a sap to waste
time trying to figure it out. Maybe it isn&rsquo;t even a
code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield paused at the table to study the
scratch pad on which the boy had been writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up, Dan,&rdquo; he advised, resting his hand
for a moment on his shoulder. &ldquo;Worthwhile things
usually come hard. Keep plugging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried every possible combination of letters.
No soap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield studied the odd grouping of numerals:
&ldquo;020614 7552845 24.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number 5 reappears three times,&rdquo; he observed.
&ldquo;If only you could figure that one out, it might give
you a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried at least twenty combinations with no
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t give up hope, Dan. Bring the message
along with you to camp. Perhaps some of the Den
Dads can figure it out while we&rsquo;re there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; Dan sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather do it
myself though. I have one more idea I want to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, who was ready to leave for home,
remarked that the hour was growing rather late.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you break it off for tonight, Dan?&rdquo; he
suggested. &ldquo;Remember, we leave early for Skeleton
Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there, Mr. Hatfield. I just want to try one
more idea. Don&rsquo;t wait for me. You and Brad go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cub leader was reluctant to leave the boy
alone in the Cave. Twice during the week, Red and
Chips had reported that they thought someone
might be spying on the clubroom.</p>
<p>Although inclined to believe the boys were fanciful,
Mr. Hatfield nevertheless disliked to leave Dan
by himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you&rsquo;ll be all right?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad and I will be glad to wait if you&rsquo;re set on
working longer on that code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need, Mr. Hatfield. I&rsquo;ll put out the light and
see that everything is ship-shape when I leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t stay too long, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In departing, Mr. Hatfield and Brad lowered a
canvas covering which served as a door across the
cave entrance. Of no practical value in protecting
the clubroom from intruders, it kept out wind and
rain.</p>
<p>Left to himself, Dan devoted himself once more
to the task at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Writing out the letters of the alphabet in orderly
rows, he gave each a number, thus:</p>
<pre>  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4</pre>
<p>and on through the alphabet.</p>
<p>When this brought no solution he tried a second
combination, starting with the number &ldquo;2&rdquo; instead
of &ldquo;1&rdquo;.</p>
<pre>  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N
  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5</pre>
<p>For the next twenty minutes he worked on, trying
many combinations. Each time, he started off with
a higher number for the letter &ldquo;A,&rdquo; working up as
high as &ldquo;7&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he decided at last. &ldquo;I may as well
go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the pad before Dan was a string of unused
alphabetical letters. Absently, with no hope of striking
upon anything that would work, he wrote in
corresponding numbers, starting with &ldquo;8.&rdquo;</p>
<pre>  A B C D E F G H I J K L
  8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
  M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3</pre>
<p>Referring to Jacques&rsquo; coded message, he then began
to transfer the numbers into counterpart letters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;&lsquo;0&rsquo; could be either C,
M or W; and &lsquo;2&rsquo; might be E, O or Y. Number 6
would have to be I or S. Number 1 could represent
D, N or X. And 4 would have to be G&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan went no further, for suddenly he saw that
the puzzle actually was beginning to make sense.
Excitedly he wrote in the first combination of letters:</p>
<pre>  020614
  COMING</pre>
<p>&ldquo;Yipee! I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found the
key!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strong gust of wind unexpectedly flapped the
light canvas which hung across the cave doorway.</p>
<p>So engrossed was Dan that he did not notice. Nor
did he see a shadowy figure crouching on the platform.</p>
<p>Then the light suddenly was extinguished. Startled,
Dan jerked to attention.</p>
<p>As he groped for a match with which to relight
the lamp, a deep voice entoned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Take warning, Dan Carter! Remain away from
Skeleton Island!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan felt the hair rise on his neck. Chills slithered
down his spine. The mysterious voice, he realized,
came from the cave entranceway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Recovering from the first shock of surprise, the
boy sprang to his feet, upsetting his chair.</p>
<p>In three long strides he reached the entrance and
jerked aside the canvas flap.</p>
<p>No one was there. But disappearing down the
steps Dan saw a lean, dark figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you!&rdquo; he shouted furiously.</p>
<p>The intruder only ran the faster, pulling a jacket
high around his neck to shield his face.</p>
<p>Angered by the threat and determined to learn
who had been spying upon him, Dan started down
the steps in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>The intruder, a fleet runner, raced across the
beach, heading for a clump of bushes along the
highway. Dan pounded closer and closer at his
heels.</p>
<p>Then, the one ahead unexpectedly tripped in the
loose sand. He stumbled and fell. In a flash Dan was
upon him, pulling the jacket away so that he could
see the culprit&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross!&rdquo; he recognized him. &ldquo;Ross Langdon! Well,
of all the dirty, low tricks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, will you?&rdquo; panted the Cub from
the rival Den. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re smashing my ribs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serves you right! So you&rsquo;ve been spying on the
Cave!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, I wasn&rsquo;t spying,&rdquo; Ross protested. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
take a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long were you hiding there behind the
canvas flap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a minute or two, Dan. Honest! I saw the
light burning, so I thought I&rsquo;d take a peek and see
who was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a lousy trick&mdash;especially that warning
about going to Skeleton Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scared you, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Ross chuckled, squirming
to free himself from the other&rsquo;s tight grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You startled me. But I don&rsquo;t scare that easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun! You nearly jumped through the roof of
the Cave! What were you working on so late, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing? You were so absorbed you didn&rsquo;t hear
a thing until I waved the canvas flap to make the
light go out. You were figuring out something with
paper and pencil. Your income tax?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little work for the Den,&rdquo; Dan replied
vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keeping it to yourself, eh? If you&rsquo;ll climb off
my mid-section, I&rsquo;ll amble back there with you. I&rsquo;ve
always been curious to see the set-up of your much
advertised Cave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Dan made no comment as he let Ross up. Both
boys dusted their clothing free of sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Ross said impatiently. He started
toward the Cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking it&rsquo;s time to go home,&rdquo; Dan
said, following the other boy reluctantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting
late&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you close up the Cave for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need any help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you do. Don&rsquo;t be so inhospitable,&rdquo; Ross
chuckled. &ldquo;You may as well invite me, because I&rsquo;m
going along anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan made no further protest as he fell into step
with the Den 1 boy. He knew that Ross had in
mind learning if he could, the nature of the paper
upon which he had been working. Dan was equally
determined to keep Jacques&rsquo; coded message a Den
2 secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Ross hadn&rsquo;t pulled that fool trick, I&rsquo;d have
had the code completely broken by this time,&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll have to take the message home,
because I don&rsquo;t want him to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Cubs climbed the stairs and entered the
dark Cave. Dan groped his way to the table and
lighted the wick of the kerosene lamp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>In its flickering light, the room somehow did not
appear exactly as he had left it. His chair lay overturned.
Papers on the table were very disordered.
Dan did not recall having left them so.</p>
<p>Not wishing Ross to see the coded message upon
which he had been working, the boy looked about
for it. But the paper was not on the table. Nor
could he find it anywhere on the floor.</p>
<p>Even the scratch papers on which he had written
various combinations of letters, had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lose something?&rdquo; Ross inquired as his gaze traveled
about the well-furnished room. He added admiringly:
&ldquo;Nice diggings you have here! Wish our
Den had a cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan, thumbing through the loose papers on the
table, made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Ross demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for some work I was doing when you
broke in here,&rdquo; Dan answered reluctantly. &ldquo;Ross,
you didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I have taken anything?&rdquo; the other
demanded. &ldquo;You were hot on my heels every
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right, Ross. You were alone when
you came here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. What you driving at anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost something&mdash;an important paper. You
saw me working on it when you came up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember, Dan. Maybe you stuffed it in your
pocket when you took after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I left everything here on the
table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To make certain, Dan searched all his pockets.
The coded message was in none of them.</p>
<p>Thinking that perhaps a gust of wind had carried
the paper far across the floor of the cave, he looked
in every corner and even under the couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross, it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he said with sudden conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could it have disappeared? Honest,
Dan, I didn&rsquo;t take a thing. And none of the Cubs
from Den 1 were with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, Ross,&rdquo; Dan assured him. &ldquo;But
someone has been in here while we were on the
beach. I sensed it the instant I came in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else missing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;ve noticed. Mr. Hatfield never allows
us to keep anything of great value here because we
can&rsquo;t lock up the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, if it was my fault, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Ross said.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have pulled that stunt, only it struck
me as a good joke. Who would have come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t figure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see anyone on the beach, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but we weren&rsquo;t paying particular attention.&rdquo;
Dan prepared to blow out the kerosene lamp.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down there now and look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys descended the long flight of wooden
steps to the beach. A pale half-moon only faintly
illuminated the stretch of glistening sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one around, Dan,&rdquo; Ross said, looking up and
down the beach. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll probably find that paper
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other boy made no reply. He was staring at
the sand near the base of the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see now?&rdquo; Ross demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has been here,&rdquo; Dan said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Footprints, you mean?&rdquo; Ross was inclined to scoff
at the other boy&rsquo;s observation. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell anything
by that. You had a Den meeting tonight.
Probably those large footprints were made by one
of the Den Dads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That could be, Ross. But I&rsquo;m noticing something
else too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t keep it a secret, Wise Guy,&rdquo; Ross
said, a trifle irritably. &ldquo;What have those bright little
searchlights of yours picked up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Dan pointed to a series of tiny circular marks in
the hard-packed sand. Approximately one-half inch
deep and perhaps a foot and a half apart, the imprints
led down-beach into a clump of bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so strange about that?&rdquo; Ross demanded.</p>
<p>Offering no reply, Dan walked over to the bush.
As he had expected, no one now was hiding there.</p>
<p>However, in the soft sand appeared additional
footprints from a large man&rsquo;s shoe. And beside them
were several mysterious circular marks which he
thought might have been made by someone using a
walking stick.</p>
<p>Dan turned to Ross who had followed him. &ldquo;Will
you do me a favor?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind?&rdquo; the other boy asked with caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say nothing to any of the Cubs about what happened
tonight&mdash;either those in your Den or mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-e-ll,&rdquo; Ross hesitated, for he knew the story
would make good telling. &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll keep mum if
you will. The joke didn&rsquo;t pan out quite as I expected.
But why do you care?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, Ross. What happened tonight convinces
me someone has been spying on the Cave.
I know Mr. Hatfield would just as soon the fact
isn&rsquo;t advertised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think a gang of boys&mdash;fellows who aren&rsquo;t
Cubs&mdash;are aiming to make trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe boys are mixed up in it, Ross.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Grownups?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be my guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ross was inclined to make light of Dan&rsquo;s theory.
&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re building up too much out of nothing,&rdquo;
he insisted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that missing paper in the
morning. Mark my words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Dan said as the two
boys started for home.</p>
<p>Actually, he had no hope whatsoever. A conviction
had grown upon him that the paper left by
Jacques never would be seen again.</p>
<p>And with its disappearance had vanished his last
chance to solve the mysterious coded message.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER 9</span>
<br />A Missing Code</h2>
<p>Dan was at the Cave before seven o&rsquo;clock the next
morning. Early as was the hour, Mr. Hatfield had
arrived ahead of him and already had moved out
most of the camping equipment which was to be
taken to Skeleton Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, hello, Dan,&rdquo; the Cub leader greeted him in
pleased surprise. &ldquo;I hardly expected to see you before
eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely expected to see myself,&rdquo; Dan grinned.
&ldquo;Fact is, I came to look for a paper I lost last night.
Mr. Hatfield, I nearly broke the code only to have
the message disappear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly the boy related everything that had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross and I agreed not to tell any of the Cubs,&rdquo;
he added. &ldquo;I figured it would only worry them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right in keeping quiet about it,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said at once. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t intended to mention it,
but for several days I&rsquo;ve had a feeling this place
is being spied upon. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any idea who may be doing it, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;None whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it has anything to do with that
message we found, or Jacques?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wondered, Dan. My mind is not at rest with
regard to that boy. Obviously he was a Cub, yet
I&rsquo;ve been unable to find any Den or Pack in which
he ever was registered. Of course, he could have
given us a fictitious first name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was miserable luck losing the coded message
last night,&rdquo; Dan complained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just figured out
the first word&mdash;&lsquo;Coming&rsquo;&mdash;when whiff went the
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paper may be here. Let&rsquo;s make a thorough
search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield swept the cave floor while Dan
searched every possible cranny. The missing paper
was not found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at least nothing else appears to be missing,&rdquo;
the Cub leader said after he had checked all
the camping equipment. &ldquo;It seems that whoever
came here last night must have been after that
coded message. Dan, if I&rsquo;d known this earlier&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have called off the camping trip,&rdquo; Dan
completed, guessing at his thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jacques must have had a connection with
Skeleton Island or the name wouldn&rsquo;t have appeared
on the paper. I have an uneasy feeling about
going there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The camp will be well guarded with so many
of the fathers going along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I realize that, Dan, but even so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs would be terribly disappointed if you
called off the trip now,&rdquo; Dan interposed. &ldquo;Oh, heck,
Mr. Hatfield, I shouldn&rsquo;t have told you about losing
that paper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, you did exactly right. Well,
I suppose it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to call off the trip on
such short notice. We&rsquo;ll go on just as we planned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thanks, Mr. Hatfield!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me,&rdquo; the Cub leader rejoined. &ldquo;Just
keep your lips buttoned and your eyes open after
we reach Skeleton Island. If you notice anything
out of the ordinary, report to me. But don&rsquo;t say or
do anything to worry or stir up the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember,&rdquo; Dan promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now lend a hand with this camping equipment,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield said briskly. &ldquo;I want to have everything
at the dock before eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours later found the Cubs in their temporary
camp on Skeleton Island. Tents already were
up, balsam beds in preparation of making, and a
trench fire started for the noon-day meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>A beach near the camp sloped gently out into
the river more than fifteen yards. This the Den Dads
marked off with ropes and floats. Beyond was a
somewhat deeper area, suitable for the more experienced
swimmers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had a diving raft,&rdquo; Brad remarked,
surveying the possibilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not build one?&rdquo; proposed Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;I
saw some old boards and a log or two lying
back in the brush. We easily can build a small
raft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an hour the Cubs busied themselves carrying
boards and logs to the riverside. Mr. Hatfield
supervised the work, showing the boys how to fit
the logs together to make a firm framework for the
platform.</p>
<p>When it was ready for use, Dan, Brad and Sam
Hatfield anchored the raft in deep water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all tuckered out,&rdquo; Dan announced, pulling
himself up on the platform to rest. &ldquo;You know,
camping is mighty hard work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is until your camp is set up right,&rdquo; Sam Hatfield
agreed. &ldquo;After that, it&rsquo;s easy. If the Scouts decide
to buy this property, we&rsquo;ll have cabins and an
improved beach. The brush will need to be cleared
away. But it will make a first class camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the Scouts decide to buy,&rdquo; Dan said, rolling
over so that the sun would warm his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The site seems ideal to me. It&rsquo;s close to Webster
City. The beach area is unusually good, and the
island has a natural spring. Plenty of woodland for
nature trails too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think the Scouts will buy it?&rdquo; Brad asked.
Seated on the edge of the raft, his dangling feet
beat a steady tattoo in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield replied.
&ldquo;There are several factors to be considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not amplify the statement, for just then
Midge&rsquo;s father called from shore to warn that lunch
would be ready in twenty minutes.</p>
<p>With a shout of pleasure, the Cubs scrambled for
the beach. Dan and Brad dived from the raft, racing
each other in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fooling, you get faster every day,&rdquo; Brad
praised his companion. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t take Ross for
a cleaning in our next swimming meet, I&rsquo;ll miss
my guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope if I win I do it in a straightaway
race, not on a technical point,&rdquo; the younger boy
rejoined. &ldquo;Ross still figures he lost on a fluke.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>By the time the Cubs were dressed, lunch was
ready. Squatting around the glowing coals, they
filled their plates with steak, potatoes and generous
helpings of carrots.</p>
<p>As his crowning achievement, Mr. Holloway produced
a pan of delicately browned biscuits baked
in a home-made reflector oven which he had fashioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does the meal taste, boys?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell!&rdquo; approved Red, reaching for another biscuit.
&ldquo;As a cook, we&rsquo;ll give you the tin medal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the last scrap of food had disappeared, the
Cubs doused sand on the fires, dispatched the dishes
and then stretched out to enjoy a rest.</p>
<p>Chips, however, soon became restless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll amble down the beach and explore,&rdquo;
he announced. &ldquo;Who knows? Maybe I&rsquo;ll find the
entrance to that old tunnel Mr. Hatfield told us
about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do, write me a letter about it,&rdquo; Brad joked,
stretching lazily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m treating myself to a snooze.
That swim made me drowsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go out of sight of camp, Chips,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
advised the boy as he started away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, Mr. Hatfield&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking the Cubs to stay pretty much in this
section of the island,&rdquo; the Cub leader explained.
&ldquo;Later on, we&rsquo;ll do our exploring in a group.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; Chips consented reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me to go along?&rdquo; Fred asked.</p>
<p>Chips, acting as if he had not heard, ambled off.
Fred, who preferred to remain in camp, let him
go alone.</p>
<p>Fresh water was needed, so Dan and Mack went
to the nearby spring for a bucket of water. The
other Cubs finished making their balsam beds. This
work completed, they joined Brad under the shade
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s become of Chips?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
presently remarked, scanning the beach area. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see him anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Chips,&rdquo; said Brad significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do indeed. His intentions are good, but he&rsquo;s
apt to wander off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd that he went by himself,&rdquo; Brad mused. &ldquo;He
really gave Fred the brush-off. Want me to see
what&rsquo;s become of him, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may look him up myself,&rdquo; the Cub leader replied,
getting to his feet.</p>
<p>However, it was unnecessary for him to go in
search. Scarcely five minutes later, Chips came running
up the beach, obviously excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, fellows!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Come quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>The Cubs uncurled themselves from comfortable
nooks, and hastened to see what was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Chips?&rdquo; Brad demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to show you something,&rdquo; the boy said
impressively. &ldquo;Gosh, it scared me half out of my
wits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you find?&rdquo; Dan demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a dog-trot, Chips led the Cubs down the beach
to a clump of willows. There he pointed dramatically
to an object lying in a slight depression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A skeleton!&rdquo; Midge exclaimed, recoiling at the
gruesome sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chips, how did you happen to find it here?&rdquo;
asked Mack with a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was just walking along the beach,&rdquo; the
boy answered vaguely. &ldquo;There it was in the sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad bent down to examine the bones and the
grinning skull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch the thing,&rdquo; Fred said, pulling back.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Brad stopped him. &ldquo;Chips, you
say you just happened along here and found this
skeleton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was exactly where you see it now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it was! After <i>you</i> put it there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, such an accusation,&rdquo; Chips protested, but
his grin gave him away. &ldquo;Okay, Wise Guy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wise enough to know varnish when I see it!
These bones all have been treated. So &rsquo;fess up,
Chips. Where did you get the skeleton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the school laboratory,&rdquo; the boy admitted
with a laugh. &ldquo;Professor Johnson let me borrow it
to play a joke on the Cubs. It would have worked
too, if you hadn&rsquo;t been so smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The joke doesn&rsquo;t seem funny to me,&rdquo; Brad replied
severely. &ldquo;It would have given us all a bad
feeling to think anyone had died on the island. We
want this camping trip to be a pleasant experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I made a mistake,&rdquo; Chips muttered, gathering
up the skeleton. &ldquo;It seemed like a good idea
when I first thought of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disheartened by the failure of his joke, he carefully
replaced the bones in a carrying box which
he had hidden in the willows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it so hard,&rdquo; Brad said, clapping him
on the shoulder. &ldquo;I know you went to a lot of bother
to pull off that joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs would have fallen for it too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, they would have, Chips. But it would have
stirred them up. You know as well as I do that if
things go wrong while we&rsquo;re here, the Scouts may
decide not to buy the island site for their camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Brad,&rdquo; Chips admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.
I won&rsquo;t pull any more stunts while we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back in camp once more, several of the Cubs
elected to try their luck fishing. Dan, Chips and
Brad, who were to help Mr. Holloway with the
cooking that night, remained behind to check over
supplies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys may bring in a few fish,&rdquo; the Den Dad
remarked. &ldquo;If so, we should have a good meal tonight.
But just in case&mdash;we&rsquo;ll be prepared to fall
back on ham and eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan wandered off to gather wood for the fire.
Upon his return with a large armful of dry pieces,
he noticed that the water pail was empty again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a herd of thirsty camels around
here,&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;I filled that bucket not
twenty minutes ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it this time,&rdquo; Chips offered, eager to make
amends for the skeleton. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done your share
of work already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing the bucket, the boy disappeared in the
direction of the spring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Brad, Dan and Mr. Holloway busied themselves
with preparations for the evening meal, setting out
supplies that would be needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about another batch of biscuits?&rdquo; the Den
Dad proposed. &ldquo;The Cubs went for them in a big
way this noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; approved Dan. &ldquo;And baked potatoes will
be easy to fix. We can wrap them in wet clay and
roast them on the coals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know where we can get any clay?&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
asked, searching through the supplies for a
package of flour. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mostly sand around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some back by the spring. I noticed it
when I was filling the water bucket awhile ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you see if you can dig up some, Dan.
Take an old tin can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spring was situated well back from the camp
site in a natural shelter of willows, ferns and vines.</p>
<p>Dan had covered less than half the distance when
Chips suddenly plunged into view. The water pail
left behind, he obviously was excited as he ran
toward the other boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan!&rdquo; he exclaimed breathlessly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I saw someone
at the spring!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan scarcely knew whether to laugh or take
Chips seriously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so strange about that?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Was it one of the Den Dads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Chips retorted, exasperated.
&ldquo;What do you think I am, anyhow? A scared cat?
I saw this man peering at me as I reached down
to dip water from the pool at the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you aren&rsquo;t pulling another skeleton trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heck, no! I swear it! Dan, I really saw this man&mdash;an
ugly looking fellow. It gave me a bad start. I
dropped the water bucket and ran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been Jabowski. I&rsquo;ve been told he
stays on the island while Mr. Manheim is away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man had dark bushy hair and hadn&rsquo;t shaved
in three or four days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure he didn&rsquo;t have horns sprouting from
his forehead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wise guy! You think I&rsquo;m making it up!&rdquo; Chips
said indignantly. &ldquo;It gave me a bad feeling, I tell
you. I wish you could have seen the way he looked
at me. It froze my blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was this monster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lurking back behind the bushes. As I started
to fill the pail, I glanced up. He was staring at me
with hatred in his eyes. Then he ducked back out
of sight. I dropped the water bucket and ran.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Dan was only half convinced that Chips was not
trying to play another joke. However, he noticed
that the boy was breathing hard and actually
looked a trifle pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably saw Mr. Jabowski,&rdquo; he said with
a shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun I did! I&rsquo;ve seen Jabowski at the Webster
City Yacht Club. It was someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fisherman maybe who came to the island by
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen any boats around all day,&rdquo;
Chips contended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back there with you,&rdquo; Dan offered. &ldquo;Come
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be so brave if you&rsquo;d seen that
leering face,&rdquo; Chips said, following unwillingly.</p>
<p>The two boys approached the spring warily. All
was tranquil. A gentle breeze stirred the dense
growth of bushes which hemmed in the spring and
pool. Otherwise there was no movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one here,&rdquo; Dan observed. &ldquo;Sure you didn&rsquo;t
imagine it, Chips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no one is here now, at any rate. I&rsquo;ll fill
the water bucket while you look around to see if
you can find any clay. We need it to wrap baked
potatoes in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Dan moved on to the spring. He stooped to drink
deeply of the cool water and then reached down to
pick up the tin bucket which Chips had abandoned.</p>
<p>In the still water of the circular pool he could
see his own reflection. And then he saw something
more!</p>
<p>Merging with the dark of the bushes was a face,
the evil countenance that Chips had described so
vividly. As he watched, fascinated, a hand slowly
was raised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Dan!&rdquo; called Chips.</p>
<p>Dan ducked. As he flattened himself, a stone was
hurled by the man who crouched in the bushes.
Sailing over his head, it struck the pool with a hard
splash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER 10</span>
<br />The Man at the Spring</h2>
<p>A commotion in the bushes informed Dan and
Chips that the man who had thrown the stone now
was retreating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; Chips cried excitedly, joining his friend
at the pool&rsquo;s edge. &ldquo;I told you the truth, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure did,&rdquo; Dan muttered, scrambling to his
feet. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t ducked, that stone would have
clipped me on the back of the head. Come on, let&rsquo;s
nail him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angry to think that the intruder had dared to risk
injuring them by deliberately hurling a stone, the
Cubs started after him.</p>
<p>Already the man was far away, moving with cat-like
tread through the dense growth of vines and
underbrush. Apparently familiar with the terrain,
he slipped between the trees like a shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use trying to follow,&rdquo; Dan decided after they
had gone only a few yards. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already missed
our chance to see who he was.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And if we trail him a long distance from camp,
he might try some of his tricks,&rdquo; Chips added in an
undertone. &ldquo;Dan, that man&rsquo;s face scared me. He
looked downright ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; Dan agreed. &ldquo;I only caught one glimpse
of his face, but that was enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever see him before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-o-o,&rdquo; Dan replied slowly. &ldquo;For just a minute I
thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy was on the verge of saying that the man
had resembled &ldquo;Frisk,&rdquo; the associate of Paper Bag
Eddie. However, his identification had been most
uncertain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought what, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. I didn&rsquo;t really see the man&rsquo;s face
plainly. Wonder why he&rsquo;d try to harm us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s report to Mr. Hatfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this suggestion, Dan promptly agreed. Picking
their way back to the pool, the boys made short
work of filling the water pail and gathering clay.</p>
<p>Back in camp once more, they took Mr. Holloway
and the Cub leader aside to relate what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man actually hurled a stone?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
questioned, his face sober.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly did,&rdquo; Dan confirmed. &ldquo;It missed my
head by inches.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Very much disturbed, Mr. Hatfield and Midge&rsquo;s
father warned the two boys to make no mention of
the incident to the other Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Mr. Suell and explore the island,&rdquo; the
Cub leader decided. &ldquo;Mr. Holloway will remain in
camp with the boys. Without letting them know
that anything is amiss, keep them there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It soon will be supper time,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find enough work to occupy their time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Suell set off at once to
search for the stranger who had accosted the boys
at the spring.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chips and Dan helped with supper
preparations, trying not to reveal their inner excitement
to the other Cubs. As time wore on and neither
the Cub leader nor Mr. Suell returned, it became
increasingly difficult to contain their secret.</p>
<p>The boys were nearly through supper when the
two finally appeared in camp. Slipping almost unnoticed
into the group around the fire, they dished
up their own suppers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learn anything?&rdquo; Dan asked the Cub leader in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you later.&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s glance warned the
boy to say no more at the moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>In silence, but with no show of uneasiness, the
Cub leader ate his supper. While the other boys
were clearing away the dishes, he took Dan, Brad
and Chips aside to relate what he and Mr. Suell
had noted in their explorations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find that fellow we saw by the spring?&rdquo;
Chips questioned before Mr. Hatfield could speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Chips. We tramped the island from one end
to the other. Not a sign of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No signs?&rdquo; Dan echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My statement wasn&rsquo;t quite accurate,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
corrected. &ldquo;We found signs in the way of footprints,
a well-beaten trail, and broken bushes. But
we failed to catch up with the man himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did the trail lead?&rdquo; inquired Chips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We picked it up by the spring and followed it
the entire length of the island through the woodland
and marsh. It emerged not far from the old
hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the fellow hid in there,&rdquo; Dan suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Mr. Suell thought. We looked the
place over, but couldn&rsquo;t get in. All the doors were
locked and the blinds drawn. If Mr. Jabowski looks
after the place for Mr. Manheim, he doesn&rsquo;t hurt
himself working at the job.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Having told the boys everything he and Mr.
Suell had learned, the Cub leader again warned
them to say nothing of the affair to the other
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, I can&rsquo;t figure out why anyone would
hurl a stone without provocation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid someone may be annoyed because the Cubs
have camped here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we had a perfect right to do it,&rdquo; Dan protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Mr. Manheim granted permission.
But things may be going on here of which he has
no knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance?&rdquo; interposed Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, because I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s just a feeling
I have. Mr. Suell and I will take turns guarding
the camp tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think the Cubs may be in danger
here?&rdquo; Brad asked, startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Brad, if I thought so, we&rsquo;d break camp and
pull out tonight. We&rsquo;ll set up a watch as a precaution.
First thing in the morning, I&rsquo;ll go to the mainland
to have a talk with Mr. Manheim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the camp work was out of the way, the Den
Dads built a huge fire on the beach. Mr. Suell then
gave the boys a brief talk on Cubbing in other countries
of the world, telling them that the organization
extended to 50 lands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And are the ideals and aims the same everywhere?&rdquo;
Brad questioned, tossing another stick of
wood into the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically so, Brad. In most countries, the Kipling
Jungle stories have been made the basis of Cubbing.
Akela is the name of the Cub leader in nearly
all nations. The two-fingered sign of the Wolf is the
Cub sign around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan, who lounged on the sand beside Brad, had
listened with keen interest. But now his attention
wandered.</p>
<p>Beyond the rim of flickering light, he thought he
saw movement. Was that shadowy form a trick of
wind and tree boughs? Or might someone be spying
upon the camp?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Dan!&rdquo; Brad nudged him hard in the
ribs. &ldquo;Mr. Hatfield just asked you to lead in the
singing of &lsquo;Cheer, Cheer, the Den&rsquo;s All Here.&rsquo; Are
you asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan tore his eyes from the area of darkness. After
all, he told himself, he probably had fancied the
shadow. Imagination played strange tricks upon a
fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he apologized. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear. Guess I
was half asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>He launched into the song which was sung to the
tune of &ldquo;Hail, hail, the gang&rsquo;s all here.&rdquo; The Cubs
joined in, singing lustily.</p>
<p>At its conclusion, the boys all repeated the Law
of the Pack, and the council fire came to an end.</p>
<p>As the Den fathers were tramping out the last of
the coals, Dan walked over to the clump of bushes
which had been directly in his line of vision. He
was relieved to find no one hiding there.</p>
<p>But on the ground beneath a blackberry bush was
a sheet of paper torn from a cheap writing tablet.
Unable to read it in the darkness, Dan took it to
Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>The beam of his flashlight picked out the scrawled
words: &ldquo;GET OFF THIS ISLAND. STAY AWAY!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A warning, eh?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield commented. &ldquo;This
little affair has gone quite far enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever left the note must have done it only
a few minutes ago,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;I thought I saw
someone in the bushes just as you asked me to lead
that song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coward!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield muttered, folding the
warning and placing it in his pocket. &ldquo;Afraid to
show his face. Instead he throws rocks and sneaks
up in the darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>More annoyed than afraid, the Cub leader made
a thorough inspection of the bush where the unknown
intruder had hidden only a few minutes
before. A few large footprints had been imbedded
in the moist turf. But the one who had left the note,
had fled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use trying to track him down in the dark,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield said in disgust. &ldquo;Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll take
this up with Mr. Manheim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With another reminder that no mention was to
be made of the matter to the other Cubs, the leader
sent Dan off to bed.</p>
<p>However, the boy observed that neither Mr. Hatfield
nor Mr. Suell turned in. Instead, the two men
posted themselves near the entrance to the tents.
Throughout the night, they kept a small fire burning.</p>
<p>Dan was awakened by the excited shouts of the
other Cubs who were donning trunks for a pre-breakfast
swim.</p>
<p>At the beach he raced Brad to the raft where
they rested for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything happen last night?&rdquo; Dan asked, eager
for a report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I heard of. Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Suell
sat up until dawn. No one came near the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; Dan said in relief. &ldquo;If things start
popping, our camping trip will be called off. I like
it here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, Dan. I hope the Scouts buy this site,
because if they do, the Cubs will get to come here
often. But I know Mr. Hatfield is worried. The way
matters are going, he isn&rsquo;t likely to recommend the
place as a permanent camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking the same,&rdquo; Dan agreed. &ldquo;Oh, well,
maybe Mr. Manheim will take a hand in finding out
who&rsquo;s hiding on the island. After all, it&rsquo;s his property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A call to breakfast sent the two boys racing full-blast
for shore. By the time they had scrambled
into their uniforms, an appetizing meal of orange
juice, bacon and eggs awaited them.</p>
<p>The Cubs ate their fill and then listened as Mr.
Hatfield outlined plans for the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Dan, Brad and Chips with me to Webster
City to pick up a few supplies,&rdquo; the Cub leader
said. &ldquo;Also to attend to an important errand. Mr.
Suell has planned a hike for those who remain
behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go to Webster City,&rdquo; said Mack, who
suspected that he was being excluded from an important
mission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; chimed in Midge. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we all go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this time,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield turned them down.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make a full report when we get back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock, the three Cubs and their leader
were picked up by launch, according to an arrangement
made with a member of the yacht club. Once
on shore, they purchased a few small items. Thereafter,
they presented themselves at Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s
office and were elated to learn that the island owner
was in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see you at once,&rdquo; a secretary told them.
&ldquo;First door to your left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room which Mr. Hatfield and the Cubs entered
through a frosted door was padded with rich,
soft carpet.</p>
<p>A heavy-set man with steel-blue eyes sat in a
swivel chair behind a desk at the window. Recognizing
the Cub leader, he smiled in welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Sam! What brings you here so bright and
early? Another proposition to buy that camp site on
Skeleton Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, Mr. Manheim. We&rsquo;re not so sure
it&rsquo;s a safe place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skeleton Island not safe?&rdquo; Mr. Manheim demanded.
&ldquo;What gave you that idea? Sit down and
tell me all about it.&rdquo; He waved everyone into
chairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield introduced the three Cubs and then
went directly to the point. He related how a stone
had been tossed at Dan and showed Mr. Manheim
the warning note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, someone is playing a joke on you,&rdquo; the
island owner said after reading the message. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
tell me you take this seriously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did and do, Mr. Manheim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nothing to cause alarm. Probably some boys
from a rival troop are having a little fun at your
expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stone was hurled by a man,&rdquo; Dan interposed.
&ldquo;I saw his face quite plainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible that tramps have taken up quarters
in the underbrush,&rdquo; Mr. Manheim said reluctantly.
&ldquo;Jabowski&rsquo;s orders are to keep hoodlums away from
the island. I&rsquo;ll jack him up a bit if he&rsquo;s been remiss
in his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jabowski is your caretaker at Skeleton Island?&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he lives there with his nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw neither of them. In fact, the old hotel
building seemed to be locked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jabowski has orders not to leave the island without
notifying me,&rdquo; Mr. Manheim said, frowning.
&ldquo;He must be there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>To Mr. Hatfield and the Cubs it became obvious
that the information they had brought was displeasing
to the island owner. Apparently to end the interview,
he arose and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t worry about a thing. I&rsquo;ll get in touch
with Jabowski and have him ascertain that the island
is free of trespassers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Manheim. We wouldn&rsquo;t have
troubled you only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble at all,&rdquo; Mr. Manheim interrupted the
Cub leader. &ldquo;I always like to help out the Cubs or
Scouts. Fact is, I&rsquo;ve been thinking for several weeks
I&rsquo;d like to give &rsquo;em a bang-up time&mdash;a regular jamboree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jamboree?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield repeated, rather mystified.</p>
<p>The island owner ignored the Cub leader, turning
to Brad, Dan and Chips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you boys like a beach barbecue? A
really big affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell!&rdquo; Chips agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll invite all the Cubs in Webster City. Make
it a bang-up affair. Tonight, shall we say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re moving a bit fast for me,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield.
&ldquo;How can you plan such an affair on short
notice?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Manheim, pressing
the desk buzzer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call in a caterer, a friend of
mine who will take care of every detail. Your job,
Mr. Hatfield, will be to have the Cubs there on the
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt the boys will jump at the chance
for a barbecue even on short notice,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
replied. &ldquo;But what about transportation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My motorboat will be available. And Jabowski
can take the overflow on a motor raft he has at the
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield gazed dubiously at the
Cubs. &ldquo;I hardly know what to say. It&rsquo;s such short
notice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble with you, Sam, is that you&rsquo;re not in
the habit of making quick decisions,&rdquo; the other said
jovially. &ldquo;You have your boys at the dock at seven
o&rsquo;clock. I&rsquo;ll take care of everything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get in touch
with the Cub leader of Den 1. I only hope you
aren&rsquo;t biting off more than you can chew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never have yet,&rdquo; the island owner said, escorting
the party to the door. &ldquo;See you tonight. We&rsquo;ll
have a jamboree that will give those Cubs the thrill
of their young lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about that man we saw at the spring?&rdquo;
Dan half-protested. &ldquo;If he should be hanging
around&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to Jabowski,&rdquo; Mr. Manheim dismissed
the subject. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give the matter another
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The island owner bowed the Cubs out. When the
door had closed firmly behind them, they eyed each
other a trifle askance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was fast work if you ask me,&rdquo; Brad
said, sucking in his breath. &ldquo;Mr. Manheim takes care
of everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In typical Manheim style,&rdquo; added the Cub leader
unhappily. &ldquo;Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve learned from past
experience that his plans don&rsquo;t always pan out
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re afraid the barbecue won&rsquo;t come off
tonight?&rdquo; Chips asked as the four started down the
hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it will be held after a fashion,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
replied. &ldquo;But Mr. Manheim is apt to leave too many
details unplanned. Another thing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man at the spring?&rdquo; Dan supplied as the
Cub leader hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m not entirely satisfied that Jabowski will
attend to him. For that matter, where is Jabowski?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has seen him since we landed on the
island,&rdquo; Brad replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It all adds up to an uncertain picture,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said soberly. &ldquo;Everything may go well tonight.
I hope so. But between you and me and the gate-post,
I&rsquo;m wondering if Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s barbecue may
not be a mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER 11</span>
<br />A Barbecue for the Cubs</h2>
<p>Despite Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s misgivings, the jamboree
came off that night according to schedule.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour, the island owner&rsquo;s motorboat
and the power raft were at the Webster City
Yacht Club docks to pick up members of Den 1.</p>
<p>Mr. Manheim personally took command of the
speedboat, while his man Jabowski carried the overflow
of boys across the river on the open raft.</p>
<p>In an ugly mood, the caretaker complained that
the barbecue was &ldquo;a lot of stupid nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, he smarted from a lecture delivered by
his employer. For three hours that afternoon the
island owner had tried to find Jabowski. Finally
tracing him to a waterfront tavern, he had warned
the man that unless he paid attention to his duties,
he would be discharged.</p>
<p>Jabowski blamed the Cubs for the reprimand,
and so did his utmost to make them feel uncomfortable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sit still!&rdquo; he ordered Ross Langdon, who shifted
his weight as the raft chugged across the river. &ldquo;You
want to upset us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, I hardly moved,&rdquo; Ross growled. &ldquo;Anyway,
if this raft isn&rsquo;t safe, you shouldn&rsquo;t be taking kids
across the river in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The raft&rsquo;s safe enough, if you behave yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are behaving,&rdquo; Ross retorted. &ldquo;For crying
out loud, what&rsquo;s eating you anyhow? You&rsquo;ve done
nothing but crab since we left the dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d crab too if your boss gave orders to have
a barbecue on eight hours notice! But that&rsquo;s Manheim
for you. Always doing things in the grand
manner&mdash;only someone else has to do the work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not much impressed by the caretaker&rsquo;s complaints,
the Cubs eagerly turned their faces toward
Skeleton Island. Huge fires burned on the beach
and they could hear the music of an eight-piece
band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is going to be a shing-ding!&rdquo; Ross said,
pleased. &ldquo;We should have a swell time tonight.
Good grub, Mr. Jabowski?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baked clams and lobster and roasted ox! That
ought to be enough to satisfy you kids and your
parents.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say! Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s doing all right by us,&rdquo; Ross
said, impressed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a swell time tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the caretaker could have landed the
raft at the beach, he proceeded up-island to a dock
which extended out into much deeper water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s the idea, bringing us clear up here?&rdquo;
Ross protested, eager to join the other boys on the
island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give your gums a rest, will you?&rdquo; Jabowski demanded
rudely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m handling this raft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last after taking his time in fastening the craft
to a dock post, he allowed the boys to disembark.
Quickly they joined the Cubs from Den 2.</p>
<p>Nearly thirty Cubs and their parents already had
arrived at the island. Mr. Manheim went here and
there, shaking hands with the grownups and joking
with the boys. The music was excellent, the food
plentiful. Yet despite the efforts of everyone to have
a good time, the party soon began to go a trifle flat.</p>
<p>At that point Mr. Hatfield and Midge&rsquo;s father
took a hand, introducing various games. The fun
revived. However, everyone appeared relieved when
the gathering began to break up at nine-thirty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Mr. Manheim took two boatloads of Cubs and
their parents to shore and returned for the third.
Meanwhile, Jabowski had made one trip in the much
slower raft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more trip will wind it up,&rdquo; the island owner
estimated, counting the Cubs who were to remain
overnight at their camp. &ldquo;I can take five, and the
others all can get on the raft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven on the raft?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield interposed in
disapproval. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that loading it rather heavily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Mr. Manheim returned, annoyed to
have his judgment questioned. &ldquo;The raft was built
to carry a much heavier load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems sturdy enough, but there are no rails&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jabowski will keep his eye on the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dismissing the matter, the island owner filled his
speedboat to capacity and pulled away. Following
orders, Jabowski herded the remaining Cubs aboard
the raft.</p>
<p>When all were seated who were to leave the
island, not a spare inch of space remained.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, who had been watching the loading
with troubled gaze, stepped to the edge of the dock
to speak to Jabowski.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not make another trip?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;The
raft is overloaded.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s orders were to take &rsquo;em all in one
load,&rdquo; Jabowski said stubbornly. &ldquo;I do as he tells
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started the motor and the raft slowly pulled
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, wait!&rdquo; Ross Langdon shouted. &ldquo;I forgot my
cap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before anyone could stop him, he leaped to his
feet. The over-weighted raft tilted sharply to the
left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; Jabowski yelled.</p>
<p>The warning came much too late. Other Cubs,
their feet under water, were scrambling frantically
for safety.</p>
<p>As the raft became even more off-balance, it
tilted to a sharper angle, sliding all the Cubs except
one into the river. Jabowski, clinging to the motor
box, managed to hold on.</p>
<p>The water into which the Cubs had fallen was
well over their heads. Weighted down by shoes and
clothing, they churned the surface in a frantic effort
to keep up.</p>
<p>Ross, an expert swimmer, seized one of the Cubs
and towed him ashore.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield and Midge&rsquo;s father both plunged in
to assist others to safety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Two of the Cubs grasped the side of the raft
and were pulled aboard by the frightened Jabowski.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on shore, Dan had kicked off his
shoes, ready to help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Tim Tyler?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>Tim was the youngest and smallest member of
Den 1. Also, as all the boys knew, he was the only
Cub who had never learned to swim a stroke.</p>
<p>In the darkness there now was no glimpse of the
boy. He was neither on the raft nor anywhere visible
in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was aboard when the raft upset,&rdquo; Dan cried.
&ldquo;I saw him just before it went over. Maybe he&rsquo;s
pinned underneath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting for others to act, the boy made a
clean dive from the end of the dock. With the speed
of a bullet he shot beneath the raft.</p>
<p>To his confusion, it was not flat underneath as he
had expected. Instead, the craft was laced with four
large metal tanks.</p>
<p>At the moment, Dan had no time to think of their
significance or to wonder why they were there. Holding
his breath, he groped about in the dark waters
of the cool river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>He felt rather than saw the body which was
wedged between the tanks in the very centermost
portion of the raft.</p>
<p>Seizing Tim by an arm, Dan attempted to swim
out with him. His head and shoulders came hard
against the metal tanks and he could make no
progress.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s breath now was growing short and he knew
he must work fast. Treading water, he used both
arms to try to free the imprisoned Cub.</p>
<p>At first he could not move the boy an inch. Then
Dan&rsquo;s hand encountered a jagged nail, and he realized
that Tim&rsquo;s clothing had speared on it.</p>
<p>With a hard jerk, he ripped the garment free.
Then, with the limp form of the boy on his left hip,
he swam and pulled them both toward the outer
edge of the raft.</p>
<p>His heart began to pound and his lungs to feel as
if they would explode. Could he keep going? He <i>had</i>
to, Dan told himself. To abandon Tim never entered
his thoughts. Only a stroke or two more&mdash;</p>
<p>When it seemed to Dan that he had reached the
very end, a strong hand grasped his clothing. Both
he and Tim, to whom he clung desperately, were
hauled up onto the raft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, Dan!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s praise rang in
his ears. &ldquo;You saved Tim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the Cubs were taken ashore to dry out by the
fire. Mr. Holloway and the Cub leader stretched Tim
out on the dock, wrapping him in blankets. It was
unnecessary to apply artificial respiration, for he
soon opened his eyes and began to breathe normally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look after Tim,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield advised Dan
as the shivering boy hovered near. &ldquo;Hike to the tent
and change your clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield, there&rsquo;s something I want to tell
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad threw a blanket over the boy&rsquo;s shoulders and
led him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Den is proud of you, Dan,&rdquo; he declared as
he waited while the other changed into dry clothing.
&ldquo;You earned yourself a medal tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; Dan replied. &ldquo;Or rather,
anyone would have done the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought and acted in a split-second. That
was what counted, Dan. If Mr. Manheim hadn&rsquo;t
been so bull-headed about taking too many Cubs on
the raft, the accident wouldn&rsquo;t have occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was badly balanced from the start, Brad. I
can&rsquo;t understand those tanks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What tanks, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why there were four of them on the underside
of the raft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tanks? You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly am. They were long and flat and made
of metal. Tim was wedged between them, his
trousers snagged on a nail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they were gasoline tanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They looked like it. But why would the raft need
so many? These tanks would hold fifteen or twenty
gallons each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing, the gas tank that feeds the motor
is on the top side of the raft,&rdquo; Brad said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;It does seem queer. You told Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I aim to. He was too busy working on Tim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan finished dressing and the two boys sought the
warmth of the fire. Tim, wrapped in blankets, was
brought there.</p>
<p>The other drenched Cubs were lent clothing by
the more fortunate boys of Den 2.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Presently Mr. Manheim returned from across the
river. Informed by Jabowski as to what had occurred,
he was profuse in his apologies for the mishap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand how it happened,&rdquo; he said to
Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve transported lumber and
very heavy objects on that raft. We never had an
accident before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a first time,&rdquo; the Cub leader replied.
&ldquo;Fortunately, no serious harm has been done.
But it was a miracle the raft upset at the dock and
not in mid-stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Mr. Manheim had taken the Den 1 Cubs
ashore in the motorboat, the Skeleton Island camp
settled down for the night.</p>
<p>Not until then did Dan have opportunity to tell
Mr. Hatfield of seeing the gasoline tanks beneath the
raft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s what made it upset,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;When the load shifted, all the fuel ran to the same
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuel tanks on the underside of a raft,&rdquo; Sam Hatfield
mused. &ldquo;That seems odd. Why would a raft
need such large carrying capacity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe to supply another boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s motorcraft has a large tank.
It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I figure Jabowski&rsquo;s been supplying that motorboat
Brad and I saw signal from across the river,&rdquo;
Dan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be selling Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s gasoline and
picking up a little extra money for himself, Dan. I
wouldn&rsquo;t put it past him. That, I suppose, would
explain those tanks underneath the raft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering too if Jabowski may not be mixed
up with the river pirates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield gazed at the boy in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Dan!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going too
fast for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one likes Jabowski,&rdquo; Dan argued. &ldquo;He has no
friends. I know because I&rsquo;ve inquired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man isn&rsquo;t very likeable, I&rsquo;ll grant, but to
accuse him of being a crook is something I wouldn&rsquo;t
venture to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not accusing him, Mr. Hatfield. I&rsquo;m only
wondering. You recall, on the night the furs were
stolen, a motorboat almost like Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s tore
into Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s sailboat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since then, police have watched the waterfront
for that boat. Especially gasoline outlets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read so in the papers, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;According to the stories, police have been puzzled
as to where the boat owners put in for fuel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re well informed on the subject, Dan,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read every word, because I&rsquo;m interested.
Maybe those river thieves have moved out of here,
but I have a hunch they&rsquo;re just biding their time
before pulling another job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be that as it may, Dan, the Cubs can&rsquo;t afford to
mix themselves in any such business. As I said before,
if I thought Skeleton Island had become a hideout
for the river thieves, I&rsquo;d never recommend that
this camp site be bought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we don&rsquo;t investigate, how can you know
if the camp&rsquo;s really safe?&rdquo; Dan argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where this conversation has been pointing,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield chuckled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re proposing that
the Cubs do a little sleuthing before we leave here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could we learn, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to find out more about Jabowski and his
habits. I have an idea, Mr. Hatfield, if you&rsquo;d hear
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this idea, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know that game we sometimes play of &lsquo;Follow
the Trail.&rsquo; One Cub goes ahead and lays out a
trail which the others tried to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield nodded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s excellent training in
observation for the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought, if you&rsquo;re willing, we might lay
the trail across the island and around Jabowski&rsquo;s
place. The Cubs could be instructed to notice anything
unusual and report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spy out the old hotel, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Maybe it wouldn&rsquo;t net anything.
Then again, we might pick up considerable information
about Jabowski.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield thought the matter over for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be here only one day longer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If
we tried out your idea, it would have to be early in
the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we may do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield replied in a tone
which was a half-promise. &ldquo;Get to sleep now, Dan.
We&rsquo;ll talk further of this tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER 12</span>
<br />Following the Trail</h2>
<p>Excitement swept the camp the next morning
when Mr. Hatfield told the Cubs they were to play
the trail game Dan had proposed.</p>
<p>Taking the boys partially into his confidence, the
Cub leader explained that he wished to obtain as
much information as possible about Jabowski or any
other occupants of the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of information?&rdquo; Mack asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a request that can&rsquo;t be explained,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
replied. &ldquo;Just keep your eyes open. If you notice
anything unusual report it after the hunt is over.
Dan will lay the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need twenty minutes start of the gang,&rdquo; Dan
announced, already making his plans.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield told the Cubs that he might be absent
from camp upon their return. He had arranged for
a yacht club boat to pick him up, as he wished to
visit Tim Tyler to make certain the boy had suffered
no ill effects from his previous night&rsquo;s ducking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be gone long,&rdquo; he told the Cubs. &ldquo;During
my absence, Brad will be in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that means you all must do just as I say,&rdquo;
Brad instructed the younger boys. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lead the clue
hunt, and I want you to stick close to me. No
stragglers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs allowed Dan a full twenty minutes start
and then set out in pursuit.</p>
<p>Midge found the first clue, a bit of bush broken
off and weighted down with stones.</p>
<p>Farther on, Red spied a forked stick which pointed
the direction. The trail avoided the marsh, skirting
the shore much of the way. Finally it wound through
a brushy hollow and came out within view of the old
hotel where Jabowski lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea of all this?&rdquo; Red demanded, sinking
down on a rock to rest. &ldquo;Dan brought us to this
old hotel on purpose, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Brad agreed. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s a note
from him.&rdquo; His keen eyes had sighted a slip of paper
speared on a nearby tree branch.</p>
<p>Obtaining it, he read aloud: &ldquo;Watch the windows
of the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The windows?&rdquo; Red repeated. &ldquo;What does he
mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Brad shrugged. &ldquo;Just keep your
eyes peeled for anything unusual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as what?&rdquo; Midge demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that. I don&rsquo;t know myself. If you
see Jabowski or anyone around, keep tab on &rsquo;em.
Pick up any information you can, no matter how
trivial it may seem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why are we doing this?&rdquo; Mack complained.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield will explain later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Dan seem to be on the inside,&rdquo; Chips
grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to play the game, you can trot
back to camp. And that goes for all of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t get tough,&rdquo; Chips retorted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re willing
to spy out the enemy camp, but it would be more
to the point if you&rsquo;d do a little explaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in good time, all in good time,&rdquo; Brad rejoined,
restored to good humor.</p>
<p>Following the trail Dan had marked, the Cubs
slowly circled the hotel building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Jabowski lives there,&rdquo; Midge declared.
&ldquo;The place is deserted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; corrected Red. &ldquo;I see smoke coming
from the chimney at the rear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad praised the boy for his observation and urged
the others to be on the lookout for other signs.</p>
<p>A little farther on, the Den Chief paused to study
the grimy windows of the ancient building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jabowski doesn&rsquo;t hurt himself keeping the place
clean or tidy,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Look at those windows!
And the weeds in the yard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the shutters,&rdquo; contributed Fred. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
banging around at every angle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad suddenly froze into alert attention. His gaze
had focused hard upon one of the upstairs hotel windows.
The glare of the sun was upon it, and for a
moment the others could not see what had attracted
his interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows, there&rsquo;s someone standing at the window!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;Not Jabowski either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like a boy,&rdquo; Chips declared, shifting his
position so that the reflected sunlight would not
blind him.</p>
<p>Huddled together, the Cubs all fastened their
gaze upon the window. Plainly they could see a
youth standing there, his face pressed close against
the dirty pane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Jeepers!</i>&rdquo; Chips whispered in stunned recognition.
&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s Jacques!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost at the same instant, Brad and the other
Cubs had made a similar observation. The boy who
stood at the window was the same one who had
vanished from the Cave only a few days earlier.</p>
<p>As the boys watched, a hand appeared from nowhere
to jerk Jacques back from the window. They
waited several minutes, but the boy did not reappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I think!&rdquo; Midge cried, recovering
from stunned surprise. &ldquo;Jacques is being held a
prisoner in there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either Jabowski or someone else saw him trying
to signal us, and pulled him back out of sight!&rdquo; Fred
added excitedly. &ldquo;I say we ought to break in and
rescue him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; Brad cautioned as the other Cubs
were ready to back up the proposal. &ldquo;Our orders
were to report back to camp. Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is an emergency,&rdquo; Chips argued. &ldquo;If
Jacques is being held a prisoner, we ought to get
him out!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe get ourselves into a peck of trouble.
Nope! Dan must have seen that boy too or he
wouldn&rsquo;t have left the note. We&rsquo;re hiking back to
camp. It&rsquo;s up to Mr. Hatfield to decide what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning deaf ears upon all protests, Brad led the
Cubs back the way they had come. Suddenly, a
figure loomed up ahead of the boys. It was Jabowski
who confronted them. From where he had come or
how long he had been secreted in the bushes, they
could not guess.</p>
<p>The caretaker&rsquo;s voice was hard and unfriendly as
he demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you think you&rsquo;re doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re playing &lsquo;follow the trail&rsquo;,&rdquo; Brad said
as the other Cubs were too abashed to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were spying on the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spying?&rdquo; Brad asked innocently. &ldquo;Why, what is
there to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Not a thing,&rdquo; Jabowski retorted, made
uncomfortable by the manner in which the boy had
turned the accusation. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t like kids swarming
over the place. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Manheim gave us permission to camp on the
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not to run wild over it. This here place is
mine and I don&rsquo;t want snoopers. Now get back to
your own end of the island and stay there!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, sure,&rdquo; Brad said, signaling the Cubs to make
no resistance. &ldquo;We were leaving anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t aim to be mean,&rdquo; Jabowski said, mollified
by the boy&rsquo;s willingness to obey. &ldquo;But a guy has to
have some privacy. That raft upsetting last night set
my nerves on edge. You the boy that dived
under it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that was Dan Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one is he?&rdquo; Jabowski&rsquo;s keen gaze swept
the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; Midge informed the caretaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no matter,&rdquo; Jabowski said. &ldquo;Git along now,
and mind what I said. You keep to your end of the
island and there&rsquo;ll be no hard feelings. By the way,
when you leaving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For good you mean?&rdquo; Brad asked. &ldquo;Why, late this
afternoon, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t be camping here another night.&rdquo;
Unmistakable relief was stamped on the caretaker&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Good-bye, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you may see us again,&rdquo; Brad said with mischievous
intent. &ldquo;Oh, say! Have you run into that
tramp who annoyed us the first day we camped
here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tramp? The one who threw the stone?&rdquo; Jabowski&rsquo;s
expression became guarded. &ldquo;No, I searched the
island after Mr. Manheim complained to me. No one
around. If anyone scared you, he&rsquo;s gone now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope so, at least,&rdquo; replied Brad evenly.
&ldquo;Well, so long, Mr. Jabowski. Sorry to have bothered
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs tramped off, and because they knew
the caretaker was watching, did not look back until
they were a long distance from the old hotel.</p>
<p>Once out of sight and hearing, the boys discussed
the important discovery they had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question that it was Jacques we saw
at the window,&rdquo; Brad declared. &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s he doing
here? And was it Jabowski who pulled him away
from the window, or someone else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a prisoner, for sure,&rdquo; Midge insisted. &ldquo;We
know someone spirited him away from the Cave.
He&rsquo;s probably been held here ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s find Mr. Hatfield,&rdquo; Brad urged,
starting along the trail again.</p>
<p>At the camp a few minutes later, the Cubs were
surprised to find the site entirely deserted. Dan was
nowhere around. Nor was Mr. Hatfield or Midge&rsquo;s
father to be found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Belatedly, Brad recalled that the Cub leader and
Mr. Holloway had expected to make a brief trip that
morning to the mainland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably where they are,&rdquo; he remarked,
his gaze anxiously sweeping the river. &ldquo;But where&rsquo;s
Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he went along,&rdquo; Fred suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Brad agreed doubtfully. &ldquo;But he
couldn&rsquo;t have returned to camp very long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the other boys aired their bedding and
attended to camp tasks, the older boy wandered
along the shore.</p>
<p>On the west beach he noticed where a boat had
been pulled up on the wet sand. The area was splattered
with footprints, both large and small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boat landed after the Cubs went trail hunting,&rdquo;
Brad reconstructed the scene. &ldquo;Dan must have come
down here to meet the folks, whoever they were.
Maybe he went away with them, or was taken
away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As far as Brad could see, the river was deserted
of small craft. However, the dense bushes lining
both sides of the wide stream provided ample protection
for any boat which might seek to keep out of
view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Recalling the motorcraft which apparently had
been serviced by the island raft, Brad became increasingly
uneasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t like Dan to go away without leaving
word,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happened to
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then his roving gaze fastened upon a pile of
three stones placed conspicuously on the beach.
Plainly they had been left there to attract attention.</p>
<p>Brad kicked aside the stones. Folded beneath the
lowermost one was a note from Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Called to Police Station,&rdquo; it read. &ldquo;No chance to
see Mr. Hatfield. See you soon&mdash;I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad read the message twice, trying to figure it
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now why would Dan be called to the police
station?&rdquo; he speculated. &ldquo;It must be something important
to bring the cops here after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad was certain that his chum had committed
no crime. But why otherwise would he be sought by
police?</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you soon&mdash;I hope,&rdquo; he reread the final words
of the note. &ldquo;That sounds as if he thinks he may run
into trouble. I wonder if Jabowski or someone who
dislikes having the Cubs on Skeleton Island turned
in a false complaint?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Decidedly worried, the Den Chief pocketed the
note and walked slowly back toward camp.</p>
<p>Without a motorboat, he knew he could do nothing
until Mr. Hatfield and Midge&rsquo;s father returned
from the mainland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice kettle of fish,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Dan at the
police station, and Jacques apparently a prisoner in
the old hotel. No telling what may happen next! And
me with all the responsibility!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER 13</span>
<br />Identifying a Prisoner</h2>
<p>After laying the trail for the other Cubs to follow,
Dan had spent some minutes watching the old hotel
at the far end of the island. He too had observed
Jacques standing at the window. Greatly excited by
the discovery, he left a note for the Cubs and then
hastened back to camp to report.</p>
<p>However, neither Mr. Hatfield nor Midge&rsquo;s father
was there, having crossed the river a few minutes
earlier.</p>
<p>Dan nervously paced the camp, wondering what
he should do. Far across the island, he could hear an
occasional shout from the Cubs as they noisily followed
the trail he had marked.</p>
<p>After awhile, the boy became aware of the approach
of a high-powered speedboat. Turning to
look, he was astonished to see that a Webster City
police patrol boat was beaching on the island.</p>
<p>As he went down to the water&rsquo;s edge, a sergeant
and plainclothesman stepped out of the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the Cub camp?&rdquo; the sergeant inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it is,&rdquo; Dan replied. He wondered what
had brought police to the island at such an early
hour, or for that matter, at any hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for a Mr. Hatfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t here just now. But I expect him back in
a half hour or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holloway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came to take one of the boys back to the
station with us,&rdquo; the sergeant explained. &ldquo;A kid by
the name of Dan Carter. Is he around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan drew in his breath, and answered uneasily:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dan Carter. Why do you want me? What have
I done now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, nothing&mdash;not a thing,&rdquo; the police officer
reassured him. &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you one of the youngsters
who saw the operator of a motorboat that struck Mr.
Holloway&rsquo;s sailboat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But how did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we check up,&rdquo; the sergeant replied with a
friendly grin. &ldquo;Remember the blindman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did tell him about the crash,&rdquo; Dan recalled. &ldquo;He
passed the information on to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right. You saw the men in that boat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not plainly. The boat was running without
lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you could identify any of the men if you
saw &rsquo;em again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them, I might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Describe him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he was short and muscular&mdash;heavily built.
His jaw was sort of square and his face puffy. I
couldn&rsquo;t see the color of his hair, but would say he
was on the dark side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty fair description, Dan,&rdquo; the sergeant
praised. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re observing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, I think I saw him twice,&rdquo; Dan replied.
&ldquo;Once in the boat and then again on shore talking
to a little fellow with a paper bag. &lsquo;Paper Bag
Eddie&rsquo;, they called him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The police sergeant and plainclothesman exchanged
a quick glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid, you&rsquo;re the one we need to help us,&rdquo; the latter
said. &ldquo;Now this is the set-up. We&rsquo;ve picked up
a man we think may have been mixed up in the fur
robbery. Also, he may be the one that rammed Mr.
Holloway&rsquo;s boat. We want you to identify him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I can,&rdquo; Dan said doubtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be glad to try.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Excited at the prospect before him, Dan scribbled
a note for Mr. Hatfield and the Cubs. This he placed
under a pile of stones on the beach where he was
certain it would be seen. He then boarded the police
boat and was ferried across the river.</p>
<p>At the police station, Dan was told to wait in an
ante-room. He sat down, thumbing through the
pages of a magazine. Policemen went in and out,
but save for an occasional glance at the boy, no one
paid any attention to him.</p>
<p>Dan began to wonder if he had been entirely forgotten.</p>
<p>After awhile, he arose and wandered out into the
first floor corridor. As he stood there watching men
and women pass through from James St. to Whitehill
Ave., he suddenly stiffened.</p>
<p>Through the revolving doors came Paper Bag
Eddie. The man was alone. His hat had been pulled
low over his eyes, and his coat collar was high, but
he carried the familiar paper sack.</p>
<p>A policeman, recognizing the man, stopped him
for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Eddie,&rdquo; he said, eyeing him guardedly.
&ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The measles,&rdquo; Eddie retorted, his thin lips curling
into a sneer. &ldquo;You got nothing on me, copper. It&rsquo;s a
free corridor, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just keep moving, Eddie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to pay a traffic fine,&rdquo; the man replied.
&ldquo;Any law against it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; the policeman said. &ldquo;Just make it
snappy and get out. We don&rsquo;t want you loitering
around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie eyed the police officer insolently, but made
no reply. Passing Dan, he entered a door which bore
a sign: &ldquo;Pay Traffic Fines Here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, he did not remain three minutes inside
the room. No sooner had the policeman stepped into
one of the court rooms, than Eddie emerged into the
corridor again.</p>
<p>His fox-like eyes darted back and forth, noting
that no other policemen were anywhere in sight.</p>
<p>This ascertained, he sidled over to Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here to identify a man you&rsquo;re supposed to
have seen in a motorboat,&rdquo; his purring voice said.
&ldquo;Get this! You never saw the guy before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, Dan stared at Eddie and made
no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have some popcorn?&rdquo; the man invited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Dan shook his head, and made uncomfortable by
those dark boring eyes, moved a step back against
the wall.</p>
<p>Eddie had opened the bag. Now he thrust it
directly under the boy&rsquo;s eyes. Dan saw then that it
contained not popcorn, but a 32-caliber revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never saw the guy before,&rdquo; Eddie repeated.
&ldquo;If you forget&mdash;you&rsquo;ll hear from me. I got a way of
taking care of my friends and them that ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two policemen had emerged from one of the
offices. Dan turned to signal to them. Before he
could do so, Eddie wheeled and departed by way
of the revolving doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Dan Carter?&rdquo; one of the policemen called,
noticing the boy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man who was talking to me!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed.
&ldquo;Did you notice him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of the policemen had seen Eddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He threatened me,&rdquo; Dan revealed. &ldquo;Warned me
not to identify someone in the line-up. And he had
a revolver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now very much interested, the policemen went
outside the building to look up and down the street.
Paper Bag Eddie was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably hailed a taxi and made a quick getaway,&rdquo;
one of the officers said. &ldquo;Listen, Dan. Don&rsquo;t
pay any attention to what he told you. It was all
bluff. You go in there and identify your man if you
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to,&rdquo; Dan announced, his face grim. &ldquo;He
can&rsquo;t scare me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; the policeman approved. &ldquo;Now follow
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan was led through a series of corridors and
up an elevator to an inner room. There he was introduced
to Detective Jim Blackwell and Sergeant
Amos Davis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now in a moment, several men will walk across
a lighted stage in front of you,&rdquo; Sergeant Davis explained.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be behind this screen, protected
from their view. Don&rsquo;t say anything, but look closely
at each man. If you recognize any of them, tell me
later. Got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan nodded. His heart pounded with excitement.
He had made up his mind to identify the motorboat
operator if he possibly could.</p>
<p>But he couldn&rsquo;t forget about Eddie and the revolver
in the paper bag. Somehow he had a feeling
that the threat had not been entirely bluff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>The stage now was flooded with blinding light.
One at a time, six men walked into Dan&rsquo;s range of
vision.</p>
<p>The first three he had never seen before and resembled
no one he had ever known. Dan gave them
scarcely a second glance.</p>
<p>At sight of the fourth man in the line-up, he
stiffened. Although the fellow tried to look unconcerned,
Dan could see that he was worried. He knew
him instantly as the sailor he had seen talking to
Paper Bag Eddie.</p>
<p>Also, he was reasonably certain that the man was
the same one who had operated the motorboat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the one!&rdquo; Dan whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men in the line-up were taken away and the
stage darkened. Dan then was led to an adjoining
room where he was questioned as to his identification
and other information.</p>
<p>Dan told the entire story, including his suspicions
that Jabowski might be supplying the river pirates
with gasoline.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>He related also how Jacques had disappeared
from the Cave under mysterious circumstances, the
theft of the coded message, and finally, of seeing
the boy again on the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gave me a real shock to see him standing there
at the window,&rdquo; he ended the account. &ldquo;I tried to
signal him, but I don&rsquo;t think he saw me. After
awhile, he stepped back out of sight. I figure though
that Jabowski is holding him there against his will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given us some good tips, kid,&rdquo; the police
officer praised Dan. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll drop around at
the island and give it a thorough going over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A raid on the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might call it that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t arrest any of the Cubs
that are camped on the island,&rdquo; Dan said anxiously.</p>
<p>His remark amused the officer. &ldquo;You figure we
can&rsquo;t tell a Cub from a crook?&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that, sir,&rdquo; Dan replied, flushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look out for your friends,&rdquo; the officer reassured
him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Orders were given for squad members to contact
Mr. Manheim, the island owner, and then to proceed
to the old hotel for a search of the premises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take you along with us, Dan,&rdquo; the officer
told him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be needed to point out this boy
Jacques who is being held a prisoner, you say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>In the squad car, the boy was driven to Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s
office. As his accusations were repeated, the
island owner bristled with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy rot!&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;My man Jabowski is
to be trusted completely! This boy must be out of his
head! Such gratitude. And after all I&rsquo;ve done for the
Cubs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After storming about for awhile, Mr. Manheim
agreed to accompany police to the island. During the
swift boat ride across the river, he refused to speak
to Dan.</p>
<p>At the Cub camp, Mr. Hatfield and Midge&rsquo;s
father both had returned. Already they had received
a report from Brad and the other boys. But to see
Dan arrive with a squad of policemen was something
of a surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re making no mistake,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
remarked to the boy after he had been informed that
the hotel was to be searched. &ldquo;Mr. Manheim looks as
angry as a hornet! If you should be wrong&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the Cubs saw Jacques at the window,&rdquo; Brad
said, coming to Dan&rsquo;s defense. &ldquo;The boy must be
somewhere on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>While the Cubs and their leaders approached the
hotel by an overland route, police made a swift
motorboat descent upon the building, tying up at
the old dock.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Mr. Manheim, they presented
themselves at the front door. There was no response
to their knock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have a key,&rdquo; Mr. Manheim said, searching
for it in his pocket. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what became
of it. I&rsquo;ve not used it in six months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then an upstairs window opened and Jabowski
looked down on the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you want?&rdquo; he demanded. Then, recognizing
his employer, he said quickly: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you,
Mr. Manheim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door,&rdquo; the island owner ordered.
&ldquo;Police insist on searching the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right down,&rdquo; the caretaker replied, leaving
the window.</p>
<p>A moment later he unlocked the front door, staring
curiously at the members of the police squad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, our orders are to search the place,&rdquo;
one of the officers apologized. &ldquo;Mind if we look
around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Jabowski shrugged. &ldquo;I only work
here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>By this time all the Cubs had reached the hotel.
However, except for Dan, Mr. Hatfield would not
allow them inside the building.</p>
<p>The lobby of the old hotel had been converted
into a makeshift living room. Scantily furnished with
a few cast-off pieces of rickety furniture, the floor
was unswept and the windows dirty.</p>
<p>Climbing a flight of squeaky stairs, the policemen
began a systematic search of the bedrooms. Nearly
all were empty and unfurnished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques was in the room to the right of the
corridor,&rdquo; Dan said, pointing it out.</p>
<p>The officer thrust open the door. A boy who had
been lying on an unmade bed, quickly got to his
feet. Fully dressed, he stared first at Dan and then
at the policemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This the boy?&rdquo; the officer demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s Jacques,&rdquo; Dan answered as the youth
stood mute.</p>
<p>Mr. Manheim and Jabowski had followed the
policemen into the bedroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name, boy?&rdquo; the police officer questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques&mdash;Jacques Jabowski.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jabowski? You&rsquo;re related to the caretaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my nephew,&rdquo; Jabowski answered before the
boy could speak. &ldquo;Anything wrong with that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>The police officer fixed Dan with an annoyed
glance. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mention a relationship, kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Dan said in embarrassment.
&ldquo;That is, I&rsquo;d heard Jabowski had a nephew,
but I never once thought of his being Jacques. The
boy was taken away from the Cave, and when I saw
him here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You jumped to wild conclusions,&rdquo; Mr. Manheim
cut in furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques will tell you I take good care of him and
provide him with everything he needs,&rdquo; Jabowski
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve kept him a prisoner,&rdquo; Dan accused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so,&rdquo; Jabowski denied. He gazed hard
at his nephew. &ldquo;You tell &rsquo;em, Jacques. Are you held
a prisoner here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacques remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer up,&rdquo; Jabowski ordered harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; the boy replied, his face sullen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques don&rsquo;t like it much here in this country,&rdquo;
his uncle explained. &ldquo;He came over from France six
months ago and is learning to speak English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Mr. Manheim broke in again. &ldquo;This
entire situation has been misunderstood. Everything
is in order here. I foolishly gave the Cub Scouts permission
to camp on my island and they&rsquo;ve allowed
their imaginations to run riot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If any mistake has been made, it was entirely
mine,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gazed at Jacques who was looking at him with
a strange expression in his eyes. It seemed to Dan
that the boy wanted to speak, that he was trying to
make something known, and yet was afraid. Dan
decided to question him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques,&rdquo; he said earnestly. &ldquo;Why did you leave
the Cave? Who took you away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came here of your own free will, Jacques,&rdquo;
his uncle replied, putting words in the boy&rsquo;s mind.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that it? Tell the officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jacques replied, his eyes downcast. &ldquo;<i>Oui</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obviously disgusted by the turn of events, the
policemen made a quick and casual inspection of
other rooms in the old hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything seems to be in order here,&rdquo; they informed
Mr. Manheim. &ldquo;Sorry to have caused you
annoyance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield and Dan also apologized to the island
owner. However, he was in no mood to accept an
explanation or to forgive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I made a mistake allowing the Cubs to come
here,&rdquo; Mr. Manheim declared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve spread damaging
rumors about the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the way you feel, we&rsquo;ll leave at once,&rdquo;
the Cub leader replied. &ldquo;An error of judgment was
made, but under the circumstance, I don&rsquo;t feel Dan
should be too severely criticized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The island owner and Mr. Hatfield now stood on
the sagging veranda, surrounded by Cubs. A few
splatters of rain drove into their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not ask you to break camp with a storm coming
on,&rdquo; Mr. Manheim said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll leave by tomorrow
morning, that will be satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll endeavor to depart before that. I&rsquo;ll contact
the mainland as quickly as I can and have a launch
come to pick up our equipment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suit yourselves,&rdquo; Mr. Manheim shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not driving you away. You&rsquo;re free to stay until tomorrow
morning. After that, I&rsquo;ll consider it a favor
if you&rsquo;ll not bring the Cubs here again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest assured we will remain away, Mr. Manheim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing. I&rsquo;ve changed my mind about selling
the camp site. You readily can see that it would
never work out to have Cubs or Scouts here. There
would be constant friction.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;On that point I could give you an argument, Mr.
Manheim. However, I realize you&rsquo;ve made up your
mind, so I&rsquo;ll say no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Mr. Manheim with Jabowski, the discouraged
Cubs trudged back to camp with their
leaders. Rain now was falling steadily, adding to
the gloom of the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brace up, Dan,&rdquo; Brad said as the two sought the
shelter of a tent. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t exactly your fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it was,&rdquo; Dan insisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve messed things
up for fair. Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s being mighty decent
about it, but I can see he&rsquo;s bothered. And the Scouts
will blame us for cutting them out of their camp
site.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants this old island anyhow? We&rsquo;ve had
plenty of trouble since we came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All caused by our own wild imagination, as Manheim
puts it! Brad, Jacques was hiding the truth
from the police! I&rsquo;m sure of it. He&rsquo;s completely
under the thumb of that uncle of his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but if we can&rsquo;t prove it, what&rsquo;s the
good in knowing? We&rsquo;ll be leaving here as soon as
this rain lets up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Dan nodded gloomily. Already Mr. Hatfield
and Midge&rsquo;s father were making arrangements to
have a launch sent from the yacht club. The moment
that the storm cleared, he knew an order would be
given to strike the tents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad, if we could talk to Jacques alone, maybe
we could get something out of him,&rdquo; he proposed
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jabowski wouldn&rsquo;t let us within a mile of the
kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if he could help himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad regarded Dan speculatively. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re suggesting
that we try to see him when Jabowski isn&rsquo;t
around, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the general idea. If we could get to him
he might talk. I&rsquo;ve messed things up for the Cubs
and I&rsquo;d like to square myself if I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad thought over the proposal. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d we get to
him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have to watch the place and sneak in
whenever we got the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will work,&rdquo; Brad said slowly. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m willing to try. Shall we tell the other Cubs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not, Brad. The idea may flop. Let&rsquo;s just slip
away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave a note for Mr. Hatfield,&rdquo; Brad said,
scribbling on the page of a notebook he took from
his pocket. &ldquo;If anything should happen that we
don&rsquo;t get back right away, he might worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older boy left the message in plain view on
his bed. Buttoning themselves into their slickers, the
pair then quitted the tent. Unnoticed, they followed
the shore for a distance, and then sliced through the
dunes to the woodland surrounding Jabowski&rsquo;s
place.</p>
<p>As upon the first occasion they had viewed the
old hotel, it appeared completely deserted. This
time, however, the boys were not deceived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jabowski and his nephew both are inside probably,&rdquo;
Brad said. &ldquo;Our only chance is to lie in wait
until we see Jabowski leave. Then we might try to
get in. We&rsquo;re taking a fearful chance though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For three quarters of an hour, the two Cubs shivered
in their inadequate shelter of bushes. Rain
continued to fall. During the entire time, no one
entered or left the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stick here forever,&rdquo; Brad said at length.
&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield will be sending a searching party
after us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess my idea was a bum one again,&rdquo; Dan admitted,
brushing a mop of damp hair from his eyes.
&ldquo;Want to leave?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a tour around the hotel first,&rdquo; Brad
said.</p>
<p>Keeping out of sight, the pair crept through the
bushes, completely circling the old building. No
one was visible at any of the windows.</p>
<p>Finally they came to the river. Thrusting through
a particularly dense thicket, Brad abruptly halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Progress was barred by an accumulation of brush
and debris. Pulling some of it aside, Brad saw a dark
opening leading back under the rise of ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, Dan,&rdquo; he murmured in awe. &ldquo;This looks
like the entrance to the old tunnel Mr. Hatfield told
us about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure does,&rdquo; Dan agreed excitedly. &ldquo;And someone&rsquo;s
found it ahead of us. The sand which blocked
the entrance was dug out, and then the opening
hidden with all this brush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out where it goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With no thought of personal danger, the boys
pulled away enough debris to permit them to
squeeze through into the dark tunnel.</p>
<p>In years past it had been bricked over, but now
water oozed through many breaks in the walls and
low ceiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This must lead to the old hotel,&rdquo; Dan said, groping
his way along the damp wall. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll get
in after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the boys had gone very far they came
upon four sturdy sawhorses where a boat obviously
had been allowed to rest while being painted. Varnish
and cans of half-used paint remained, but the
boat had been removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, I get it all now!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed. &ldquo;That
boat which struck Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s sailing craft was
painted and outfitted here in the tunnel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And painted to resemble Mr. Manheim&rsquo;s speedboat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I dope it, Dan. Let&rsquo;s see what lies
further on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Highly excited by their discovery, the two boys
moved rapidly on down the tunnel. Presently, a
series of ten stone steps led up to a small bricked
room which they judged must be directly beneath
the hotel.</p>
<p>But to the disappointment of the Cubs, the room
was empty save for a few empty boxes, from which
all markings carefully had been removed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, you know what I think!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed,
taking care to keep his voice low-pitched so that it
would not carry to the rooms above. &ldquo;This room has
been used for the storage of loot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The furs stolen from the warehouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me. Why, it was a perfect
set-up! The crooks snatched the stuff and made a
quick dash across the river. No one became suspicious,
because the boat looked exactly like Manheim&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They unloaded the boxes here, and then if police
checked the boat, of course they&rsquo;d find nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly! Then after the theft blew over and
police weren&rsquo;t watching the waterfront as closely,
they moved the stuff out and disposed of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad, I was right after all! Jabowski is mixed up
in this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but we have no proof,&rdquo; Brad brought
him up short. &ldquo;While we&rsquo;re pretty certain in our
own minds what happened, the evidence isn&rsquo;t conclusive.
All we have here is a few empty boxes. It
doesn&rsquo;t establish anyone&rsquo;s guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Dan admitted unwillingly. &ldquo;If we
went to the police with this, they&rsquo;d probably give
me the jolly ha-ha again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see where this tunnel comes out,&rdquo; Brad
proposed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Quitting the bricked room, the boys followed a
dark passageway until they came to a solid oak door.
It was locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the end,&rdquo; Brad whispered. &ldquo;The door
must enter the hotel. Jabowski may go back and
forth, but he&rsquo;d never admit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think we should do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell Mr. Hatfield, of course. He may go to
the police, but I doubt it. The Cubs already are in
Dutch with Mr. Manheim. If we make any more
accusations we can&rsquo;t prove, he&rsquo;ll have a right to be
furious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this we can prove,&rdquo; Dan argued. &ldquo;The tunnel
is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the unfortunate part, Dan. It always has
been here. We can&rsquo;t tie a thing onto Jabowski or
those other fellows unless police should catch &rsquo;em
red-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine chance of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may try to pull another job. What was the
date on that coded message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 24th. I remember because it&rsquo;s the day of our
Pack swimming meet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That date may have significance,&rdquo; Brad speculated.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not for us to decide. Let&rsquo;s get out of
here now and give Mr. Hatfield all the facts. Then
he can take the responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan knew that the older boy&rsquo;s advice was sound
and should be followed. But it was with a sinking
heart that he followed Brad through the damp tunnel
to the river.</p>
<p>He was willing to bet that neither the Cub leader
nor police would favor another raid on the island.
His attempt to straighten out matters had failed!
Time had run out.</p>
<p>Through his bungling, the Cubs would lose their
island camp. And there wasn&rsquo;t a thing he could do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER 14</span>
<br />Victory for Den 2</h2>
<p>At the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; swimming pool, Dan Carter and the
Cubs lounged against the tiled wall, awaiting the
signal for start of the long-awaited Pack meet.</p>
<p>The gallery was jammed with spectators, for
parents and friends of both teams had turned out in
large numbers to witness this decisive contest of the
season. A large silver cup, to be awarded the winning
Den, stood on a table in plain view of the
swimmers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, I sure hope we can win that beautiful
baby,&rdquo; Midge said, gazing longingly at the trophy.
&ldquo;Dan, we&rsquo;re depending on you to do your stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sure try,&rdquo; Dan replied, shivering in his wet
suit. &ldquo;But you know Ross! He&rsquo;s jet propelled. Furthermore,
he hasn&rsquo;t forgotten how we won that last
meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the boys talked, Ross himself sauntered past.
He paused to hitch up his trunks and fix Dan with
an amused eye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be too bad for you, little shrimp,&rdquo;
he jeered. &ldquo;This time, you won&rsquo;t win on a fluke! In
fact, you won&rsquo;t win. Period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure,&rdquo; Midge cut in. &ldquo;Take a look
at the events that have been posted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s different about &rsquo;em?&rdquo; Ross demanded
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coaches got together and substituted a 75-yard
free style for the 50-yard. They figure it&rsquo;s a
better test of swimming form. In the shorter distance,
a good turn at the wall gives a fellow a big
advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one told me about changing the distance,&rdquo;
Ross muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out about this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs saw him arguing vigorously with his
own coach and Mr. Hatfield. The two men listened
to his complaint but did not change the list of scheduled
events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way, Ross,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield explained. &ldquo;The
Cubs steadily have increased their endurance as
well as their speed. At the beginning of the season,
a 50-yard swim was a hard race for everyone concerned.
Now it&rsquo;s a breeze. The 75-yard freestyle is
a far better test of one&rsquo;s real ability.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I guess so,&rdquo; Ross admitted, but he looked
worried. Though the Den 1 coach had urged him
many times to practice the longer length, he nearly
always had stopped short at the end of two turns.</p>
<p>While waiting for the starting signal, Dan at the
other end of the pool allowed his gaze to wander
over the packed audience. In the back row near the
door he caught a glimpse of a short little man whose
sharp-featured face gave him a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midge, look over there!&rdquo; he muttered, nudging
his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone now,&rdquo; Dan returned. &ldquo;Slipped out
through the door. For just a minute I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shrill blast from Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s whistle drove
the matter from his mind entirely. Scrambling to his
feet, he lined up for the first event of the meet.</p>
<p>In rapid order the events were run through, the
back stroke, fancy diving, the 100-yard relay race,
and a breast stroke event. With only one event remaining&mdash;the
75-yard freestyle, the score stood 20 to
16 in favor of Den 2.</p>
<p>To win the meet the Cubs of Den 2 knew that Dan
must defeat Ross for first place. But in the freestyle
relay event, the Den 1 swimmer had put on a spectacular
burst of speed to capture the event. The
prospects looked discouraging.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just swim your own race, Dan,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
advised as the boy went to the starting line.</p>
<p>The swimmers crouched above their lanes awaiting
the signal. Sensing that the race would be a close
one, the audience rose to its feet.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s revolver cracked and the swimmers
were off.</p>
<p>Almost together Ross and Dan struck the water
in flat, fast racing dives. From the start, the Den 1
swimmer took the lead.</p>
<p>Dan heard the groans of dismay from his teammates
and instinctively increased the tempo of his
thrashing legs. Then he told himself he could not
hold the pace. Deliberately, he dropped back to his
former rhythm.</p>
<p>The race would be a gruelling one at the end. He
must save a little reserve for that final spurt!</p>
<p>At the turn, Ross was nearly two body lengths
ahead of Dan, his closest competitor. Midge and a
youth who swam for Den 1 were almost neck-and-neck
another three feet behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>After the second length, Ross slowed down a bit.
Dan&rsquo;s arms and legs now were moving with the easy
precision of well-oiled machinery. Going into the
final turn, the boy suddenly realized that for the
first time in the race, he was a foot ahead!</p>
<p>The knowledge shocked him into losing the
smooth rhythm of his stroke. Ross, desperate to regain
the lead, spurted ahead once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Dan!&rdquo; his teammates pleaded. &ldquo;Come
on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Across the pool, the Cubs of Den 1 were urging
Ross to give his all. Both boys put on a final thrust
of speed.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s arms ached with fatigue but his breath was
good. <i>Fight, fight, fight!</i> The words pounded
through his brain and conveyed themselves to his
thrashing legs. His driving arms churned the water
to foam as he put forth a supreme effort.</p>
<p>The finish line was just ahead. As Dan surged for
it with a feel of power and strength, Ross suddenly
seemed to cave in. His stroke lost all rhythm, arm
and leg movements became jerky.</p>
<p>Dan moved steadily ahead of him, touching the
wall a full length ahead. The audience burst into
loud applause. Midge who came in third, after Ross,
also was given a big hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you did it, boy!&rdquo; Brad declared, clapping
Dan on the back. &ldquo;Look at that scoreboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield was writing up the chalk figures&mdash;26
to 19 in favor of Den 2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve won the silver cup!&rdquo; Chips Davis added,
joining in the congratulations. &ldquo;And not on any
fluke either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His breath recovered, Ross came around to offer
Dan his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You swam a dandy race and deserved to win,&rdquo;
he said warmly. &ldquo;From now on, I&rsquo;m going in for
heavy practice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next year we&rsquo;ll have a real race,&rdquo; Dan grinned.
&ldquo;You gave me stiff competition this season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following his teammates to the dressing room,
the boy showered and scrambled into street clothes.
Victory had brought a warm inner glow. He felt at
peace with the world.</p>
<p>The feeling, however, was short lived. In leaving
the dressing room, he chanced to hear Mr. Holloway
and the Den 1 coach discussing prospects of obtaining
Skeleton Island as a Scout camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deal&rsquo;s definitely washed up,&rdquo; Midge&rsquo;s father
told the coach. &ldquo;Too bad, because the site is the
best one around Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Since the weekend when the Cubs had camped
on the island, Dan had not seen Mr. Manheim or
the caretaker, Jabowski. He and Brad had reported
to Mr. Hatfield their discovery of the old tunnel
leading under the hotel. However, the Cub leader
had not considered it advisable to take the matter
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s useless to speculate on what may have happened
there,&rdquo; he told the disappointed boys. &ldquo;To
impress Mr. Manheim or the police, we need evidence.
Without it, we&rsquo;ll be wise to let matters rest
as they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan also had been discouraged to learn that Frisk
Fagan, the motorboat operator, had been released
from jail on bond. Realization that the man was at
liberty gave the boy a few uneasy moments. Though
he expected no trouble, he could not forget that he
had been warned not to identify the man.</p>
<p>As Dan removed his coat from the locker, Mack
came hurrying up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;re wanted outside,&rdquo; he informed. &ldquo;A
man wants to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he, Mack?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; the other flung over his shoulder as
he went on toward the dressing room. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s waiting
out in front of the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan put on his coat and started for the street. By
this time the main part of the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; building was
nearly deserted of visitors.</p>
<p>As he stepped out onto a stone porch giving exit
to the street, a little man in an overcoat pulled high
around his neck emerged from the shadows. Dan
recoiled.</p>
<p>The man was Paper Bag Eddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Dan,&rdquo; the other said in his purring voice.
&ldquo;Want to take a little ride with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan started to retreat into the building, but Eddie
blocked the doorway. The dark street was deserted
except for a taxi cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let out a peep or make a false move,&rdquo; the
man said, tapping the little paper bag he carried.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking a firm grasp upon Dan&rsquo;s arm, he shoved
him toward the waiting taxi cab.</p>
<p>The boy braced his feet and started to resist. But
as he opened his mouth to let out a yell for help,
Eddie jammed the paper bag into his ribs. He felt
the pressure of a revolver press against his flesh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yip, or I&rsquo;ll let you have it,&rdquo; the little man
said in his pleasant voice. &ldquo;Just get in that taxi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan obeyed. As he slumped in the rear seat, he
took a quick glance at the driver. Though the face
was unfamiliar, he thought the man resembled one
of the persons he had seen on the night Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s
motorboat had been struck. It was an ugly
face, cold and unfriendly. He realized with a sinking
heart that any appeal to the driver for help would
be a waste of breath.</p>
<p>Eddie sat close beside Dan, his stubby legs
stretched out in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a little score to settle, Dan,&rdquo; the man
said, eyeing the boy narrowly. &ldquo;Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words sent an icy chill chasing down Dan&rsquo;s
spine. Eddie hadn&rsquo;t forgotten his identification of
Frisk Fagan. And this was the payoff!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you taking me?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Eddie merely smiled and settled back in the cab.
The taxi driver, without an order, shifted gears and
they sped away.</p>
<p>Along the brightly lighted street, Dan saw many
persons he knew walking home from the swimming
meet. But he was helpless to signal them or to let
anyone know of his plight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>At the next corner, the taxi turned, seeking a
narrow, dark street. Gradually it came to Dan that
he was being driven to the waterfront. His uneasiness
increased.</p>
<p>The cab presently pulled up not far from a familiar
group of warehouses. Eddie made no move to
leave the taxi. Instead, he seemed to be waiting for
someone.</p>
<p>Within five minutes, a tapping sound was heard
along the dark street. Craning his neck, Dan saw the
blindman and his dog approaching the cab.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s heart leaped with hope. If only he
could get word to the man, or in some manner make
known his predicament!</p>
<p>But a moment later Dan&rsquo;s hopes nose-dived. The
blindman came directly to the cab. He greeted
Eddie as an old friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to be late,&rdquo; he apologized. &ldquo;You got the
kid, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Eddie replied, lowering the cab window.
&ldquo;Everything set?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shipment&rsquo;s in, settin&rsquo; out on Dock 23 covered
with canvas. All we gotta do is distract the watchman
while the sawing goes on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>As he spoke, the blindman removed his dark
glasses. His eyes as they coldly appraised Dan
looked perfectly normal. With a shock the boy
realized that Joe Matt never had been blind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been a spotter for the gang of river pirates!&rdquo;
Dan thought. &ldquo;All the time he&rsquo;s kept watch of shipments
to learn when valuable ones go through! Hank
foolishly told him everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belatedly, it occurred to him that this was the
night of the 24th. The blindman had learned long
ago that a valuable shipment of furs or other merchandise
was to be sent through on this day.</p>
<p>As Dan figured it out, the boy Jacques undoubtedly
had been assigned to relay the information to
a member of the gang. The coded message must
have referred to the shipment and was in effect
&ldquo;Coming through on the 24th!&rdquo; But something had
gone awry. Either Jacques had rebelled or had met
with an accident as he crossed the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why the boy wouldn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t dare. He was afraid of what the gang
would do to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s meditation was cut short by a poke in the
ribs from Paper Bag Eddie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; the man ordered. &ldquo;If you do exactly
as you&rsquo;re told, you won&rsquo;t be hurt. But don&rsquo;t try any
monkey business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan was forced to walk along the dock ahead of
the blindman and his dog. Eddie loitered far behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now get this,&rdquo; Joe Matt said. &ldquo;One false move
and Rudy will tear you to shreds. You&rsquo;ll do exactly
as I say. These are your orders: You&rsquo;re to talk to
Hank and keep him occupied. I don&rsquo;t care what you
say, just so you hold his attention. If you fail&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m to be a decoy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to throw him off his guard. Just keep him
away from the dock while our work goes on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work! You&rsquo;re stealing another shipment of furs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, my boy. From under Hank&rsquo;s very nose
too!&rdquo; The blindman paused in the shadow of the
warehouse. &ldquo;See the stupid fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warehouseman nervously paced back and
forth along the dock. Frequently he paused to glance
at a pile of boxes which had been covered by a
heavy canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you aim to get the furs?&rdquo; Dan whispered.
&ldquo;If you make any false move, Hank will blow his
whistle and the river police will be here in a flash.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry yourself, my boy. Just do as
you&rsquo;re told and don&rsquo;t ask questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blindman gave Dan a shove, following a pace
behind. At sound of his tapping cane, the warehouseman
whirled around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; he said in relief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mite jumpy
tonight. Guarding a valuable cargo. She&rsquo;s due to be
picked up in another hour. It sure will be a load off
my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hank, I got a sliver in my hand a minute ago,&rdquo;
the blindman said in a half-whine intended to arouse
sympathy. &ldquo;Will you help me get it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see a thing out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come inside where there&rsquo;s a good light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warehouseman hesitated. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t leave
the dock&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it will only take a minute. You can watch the
canvas from the doorway. Dan here can help you
keep an eye on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My eyesight isn&rsquo;t very good at night,&rdquo; Dan said
significantly.</p>
<p>The blindman&rsquo;s arm pressed hard into his flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead me inside, Dan,&rdquo; the man ordered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
a good boy. You&rsquo;re a real help to a poor soul without
any eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>The three entered the warehouse where they
switched on a bright electric light. Carefully he
examined the blindman&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a little sliver,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hardly worth
bothering about. Here, I&rsquo;ll get it out in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his knife he removed the tiny piece of
wood.</p>
<p>Dan, who stood where he could see the canvas
which covered the crate of furs, thought he could
hear the indistinct sound of someone sawing wood.
But he could see no one.</p>
<p>Then the explanation dawned upon him! Hours
before, a boat had slipped in beneath the dock, lying
in wait for this moment. Now the river pirates boldly
were carving through the dock with steel braces,
bits and saws!</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the blindman himself had given the
go-ahead signal by tapping with his cane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those crooks will have the box through the hole
and into their boat before Hank catches on!&rdquo; he
thought.</p>
<p>Dan sidled toward the door. Rudy growled and
barred his way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Outside the warehouse, Eddie lounged against a
wall, smoking a cigarette. All escape was cut off.
Even if he could let Hank know what was happening,
Dan knew it was too late to prevent the theft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dan, how did you do in the swimming
meet tonight?&rdquo; Hank asked, making conversation.
&ldquo;Give us a full account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won,&rdquo; Dan answered shortly.</p>
<p>Again he felt Matt&rsquo;s hard pressure on his arm.
Knowing that he was expected to keep the warehouseman
interested, he grudgingly added a few
details.</p>
<p>From where the boy stood, he could see the high
mound of canvas. Suddenly it deflated like a pricked
balloon.</p>
<p>The river pirates had succeeded in lowering the
loot through the dock hole into their boat! In another
moment they would speed away unchecked.</p>
<p>The sight goaded Dan beyond thought of personal
risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Hank!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re stealing the
furs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The watchman whirled toward the door, only to
have Joe Matt&rsquo;s cane crash down on his head. Hank
staggered back, slowly collapsing on the floor.</p>
<p>When Dan would have leaped to the man&rsquo;s
assistance, the dog barred his way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Joe Matt seized the boy by the arm, pushing him
roughly out the door. Dan resisted with all his
strength. But he was powerless in the grasp of the
other.</p>
<p>The motorboat, loaded with the boxes and crates
of furs, had emerged from beneath the dock. As it
coasted alongside, the blindman shoved Dan ahead
of him and down into the craft.</p>
<p>Frisk Fagan crouched at the steering wheel.
Jabowski, his face well hidden beneath a cap, huddled
beside one of the boxes which had been shoved
half way into the cabin. Jacques sat slumped over
in the stern of the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; Frisk Fagan growled.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t take that kid along. We&rsquo;re overloaded
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got to take him along,&rdquo; Joe Matt answered.
&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;ll spill everything to the cops. Git
going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaping down into the boat, the man bound Dan&rsquo;s
legs and wrists with a stout piece of cord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better gag him too,&rdquo; Fagan advised. &ldquo;The river
is swarming with cops. Three boats out watching
the shore. We can&rsquo;t risk having him yip at the wrong
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix him right,&rdquo; Joe muttered. He pulled the
thongs tighter about the boy&rsquo;s wrists and stuffed a
handkerchief into his mouth.</p>
<p>The motorboat sped away from the dock, nosing
directly toward Skeleton Island.</p>
<p>Scarcely was the craft well out from shore than
those aboard heard the shrill blast of a police
whistle. Dan&rsquo;s heart leaped with hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been seen!&rdquo; Joe Matt muttered. &ldquo;Either
that, or Hank has revived and given the alarm!
Faster, Frisk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pushin&rsquo; her as hard as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A police boat is putting out from shore now,&rdquo;
Joe Matt informed, scanning the river. &ldquo;Probably
armed with a 45-calibre submachine gun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep cool,&rdquo; Frisk advised. &ldquo;We have a head start.
We&rsquo;ll make the island okay and can hide the boat in
the tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if it&rsquo;s found there I&rsquo;ll take the rap,&rdquo; Jabowski
whined. &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d never mixed me up in this
dirty mess. And you dragged Jacques in against his
will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Frisk said harshly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get out
of this. But if we don&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll all take the rap together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Throw the cargo overboard,&rdquo; Jabowski pleaded.
&ldquo;Then the cops won&rsquo;t find any evidence even if they
do catch up with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He arose and reached for one of the smaller boxes.
Joe Matt shoved him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay off!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;We went to plenty of
risk to carry out this job tonight. We ain&rsquo;t pitching
any $10,000 haul just because a copper blows a little
tin whistle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time, a powerfully motored police boat
had taken up the pursuit. Jabowski watched anxiously
as its brilliant searchlight swept the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming up fast!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
soon be within firing distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your shirt on,&rdquo; Frisk advised, hunching
lower over the steering wheel. &ldquo;The cops don&rsquo;t
know for sure we got the stuff. They may take the
boat for Manheim&rsquo;s just as we figured. While they&rsquo;re
wondering whether they dare risk taking a shot,
we&rsquo;ll make the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; Jabowski said fearfully. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re gaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make the island,&rdquo; Frisk repeated with more
confidence. &ldquo;The Dawson Street bridge is just
ahead. Once past there, we&rsquo;ll be hidden from view.
We&rsquo;ll slip behind the island into the tunnel. You left
Manheim&rsquo;s boat tied to the wharf?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, just as you ordered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. If the cops come by and check they&rsquo;ll find
the motor cold. You can claim you haven&rsquo;t been
away from the island all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll question me. I&rsquo;m not willing to take the
rap while the rest of you get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cops can&rsquo;t prove a thing once we make the
tunnel,&rdquo; Fagan growled. &ldquo;This is our last haul in
this area. You&rsquo;ll get your share and we pull out to a
safer spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We pull out all right,&rdquo; Jabowski muttered. &ldquo;After
tonight I&rsquo;m through. I never should have dragged
poor Jacques into this mess&mdash;he tried to run away&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The caretaker glanced briefly at his nephew, huddled
in the stern of the boat. Jacques gave no sign
he had heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the cops overtake us&mdash;&rdquo; Jabowski whined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pipe down,&rdquo; Frisk said irritably. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
coming to the bridge now. We&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lying quite helpless on the deck of the speeding
motorboat, Dan suddenly saw Jacques come to life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>With no warning whatsoever, the boy sprang to
his feet. Savagely, he hurled himself upon the surprised
Frisk Fagan, wresting the steering wheel from
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, have you gone crazy?&rdquo; Frisk shouted.</p>
<p>With both hands he gave the boy a mighty shove
which sent him reeling backwards over the gunwale.</p>
<p>Out of control, the motorboat crashed with terrific
impact into the bridge pier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER 15</span>
<br />The Pay-Off</h2>
<p>Dan was hurled violently into the foaming water.
As he went under, he held his breath and instinctively
turned his head upward.</p>
<p>After what seemed an eternity, his face emerged
from the water.</p>
<p>But the boy was helpless, bound hand and foot.
He rolled over on his back, trying to float. The gag
in his mouth had become water soaked. He began
to choke.</p>
<p>This, he thought, was it.</p>
<p>As black despair claimed him, a hand reached
out of nowhere to support his back. The gag was
jerked from his mouth so that he could breath again.
Gratefully, he sucked in big mouthfuls of air.</p>
<p>Twisting his head, Dan saw that it was Jacques
who had saved him. The boy was treading water
beside him, supporting his body with his left hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie still,&rdquo; Jacques commanded. &ldquo;I tow you.
Police boat come. Pick us up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Even as he spoke, the powerful beam from the
approaching launch spotlighted the water about
them. A moment later, both boys were hauled
aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacques, you saved me,&rdquo; Dan murmured gratefully
as the other boy bent to unfasten the ropes
which bound him. &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gravely they shook hands and wrung the water
from their dripping garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you deliberately crashed the boat so the
police would catch up with us,&rdquo; Dan added. &ldquo;Why,
Jacques?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy shrugged. &ldquo;Only way,&rdquo; he answered
briefly.</p>
<p>After freeing Dan, Jacques watched anxiously
while police picked up his uncle, Frisk Fagan and
Joe Matt. The three had saved themselves by clinging
to the sinking motorboat.</p>
<p>Before the men could release the boxes of stolen
furs, police had them covered. They were forced
aboard the launch, and the smashed motorboat taken
in tow. Fagan&rsquo;s forehead was cut and Jabowski
nursed an injured arm. Otherwise the crash had left
them unscathed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This was your fault!&rdquo; Joe Matt accused Jacques
savagely as a policeman snapped handcuffs on his
wrists. &ldquo;Yellow rat! I wish I&rsquo;d let you go that time
you sneaked away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the ride back to the dock, police officers
took detailed statements from both Dan and Jacques.
The later spoke in broken English and had difficulty
in telling his story.</p>
<p>However, he revealed that in recent weeks he had
been held virtually a prisoner at Skeleton Island.
Brought to America from France by his uncle, everything
had gone well until Jabowski had fallen in
with evil companions.</p>
<p>On the night that the Cubs had found him lying
exhausted on the beach, the boy had been assigned
to carry a message in code to Joe Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did that message say?&rdquo; Dan asked. &ldquo;I
figured out only the first word before it was snatched
from the Cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming through 24,&rdquo; Jacques revealed. &ldquo;Today
the 24th.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That meant the fur shipment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacques nodded, explaining that the message, relayed
by tip-off men to his uncle, had been intended
for Joe Matt. But instead of delivering it, the boy
had made up his mind to run away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I leap from my uncle&rsquo;s boat and swim away in
dark,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Reach shore. Hard swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were plenty tired when we found you,&rdquo; Dan
recalled. &ldquo;I understand now why you were unwilling
to talk. You were deeply involved with your
uncle and the gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle good to me,&rdquo; Jacques said simply. &ldquo;Bring
me to America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get the picture now,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;Without meaning
to, I let Joe Matt know you were staying at the
Cave. He came there and made you return to your
uncle, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacques nodded, his eyes on the shore lights which
now were close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That explains those peculiar circular marks in the
sand,&rdquo; Dan went on piecing the story together.
&ldquo;They were made by Joe Matt&rsquo;s cane! Oh, he was
clever, pretending to be blind. All the while, he
picked up information and relayed it to members
of the ring. Hank considered him a friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The launch reached the dock and the three prisoners
were herded ashore. Hank Hawkins, having
revived from the blow Joe Matt had struck, readily
identified the boxes of furs as the ones stolen from
his company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Another one of the gang got away!&rdquo; he told police
excitedly. &ldquo;He pulled out in a taxi cab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be Paper Bag Eddie,&rdquo; Dan informed.
&ldquo;The driver of the cab was in on the deal too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em both,&rdquo; the boy was assured. &ldquo;If
not tonight, within a day or two. Eddie is the key
man of a ring of river pirates. The gang is composed
of tip-off men, highjackers, a lawyer and a bail
bondsman. Also a fence or two who sell the loot.
But we&rsquo;ll round &rsquo;em up in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three prisoners and Jacques as well, were taken
to the police station to be booked on larceny charges.
However, officers assured Jacques that he would
not be held for trial, providing he would testify
against Joe Matt and other members of the gang.
This the boy agreed to do.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s narrow escape at the hands of the river
pirates became the talk of Webster City during the
next few days. Especially was his adventure the
chief topic of conversation among the Cubs of both
Dens 1 and 2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hero, Dan,&rdquo; Brad told him proudly.
&ldquo;Why, you brought that gang to heel single-handed!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give me that line,&rdquo; Dan laughed. &ldquo;I was
just an unwilling passenger. Jacques was the one
who brought about the capture. To do it he had to
turn his own uncle in and risk prison himself. That
kid sure has what it takes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a Cub too,&rdquo; Brad said proudly. &ldquo;He joined
in France. Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s trying to make arrangements
to keep him here in Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll join our Den!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping. He&rsquo;ll be a live wire, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As both boys knew, Jacques had been released on
probation to Mr. Hatfield. Temporarily, the French
lad was living in the Cub leader&rsquo;s home where he
would remain until called to testify in court.</p>
<p>Three days elapsed. At the end of that time the
Cubs were elated to learn that Paper Bag Eddie had
been captured in a neighboring city. Thereafter, one
by one, other members of the ring were arrested
and returned to Webster City to face charges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that the entire gang is in the jug, I feel a
lot safer,&rdquo; Dan remarked one night to Brad. The
two boys had arrived early at the Cave prior to a
Den meeting at which Jacques was to be taken in
as a member. &ldquo;For awhile, I couldn&rsquo;t look a sack of
popcorn in the face!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>One by one, the Cubs and their parents began to
arrive for the meeting. Mr. Hatfield started it off
with a little talk. First he told the boys how proud
he was that Den 2 had won the swimming meet and
the silver trophy which now graced a table in the
Cave.</p>
<p>Next the Cub leader paid tribute to Dan for his
coolness in the face of danger. Finally he spoke of
the Cub ideals and the honor of the organization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real Cub always is square,&rdquo; he emphasized,
smiling across the room at Jacques. &ldquo;Crooked people
are unfair, even to themselves. So the Cub follows
the law of God and man. I commend Jacques for
being true to the ideals he was taught as a Cub. The
organization is proud to claim him as a member.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Jacques!&rdquo; proposed Dan.</p>
<p>The Cubs gave them with a will. Mr. Hatfield was
on the verge of proposing a song, when footsteps
were heard on the steps leading up to the Cave.</p>
<p>Everyone turned to see Mr. Manheim standing in
the doorway. The owner of Skeleton Island looked
a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope I&rsquo;m not intruding,&rdquo; he said awkwardly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, Mr. Manheim,&rdquo; the Cub leader
replied. &ldquo;The Cubs always are pleased to have
visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter of fact, I came here on business,&rdquo; the
island owner said, entering the clubroom. &ldquo;May I
have permission to speak a few words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The floor is yours,&rdquo; the Cub leader told him.</p>
<p>Mr. Manheim faced the circle of Cubs. He cleared
his throat and then began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, I owe you an apology. I&rsquo;ve meant to come
here before, but the truth is, I&rsquo;ve been ashamed.
You all know what happened at Skeleton Island. My
man Jabowski, in whom I placed great trust, deceived
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly made aware that Jacques was in the
group, Mr. Manheim coughed in embarrassment
and added quickly: &ldquo;But that is not what I came
here to say. I apologize to the Cubs for misjudging
them. Events have proven conclusively that Dan
Carter was right and that I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the circumstance, your mistake was
natural, Mr. Manheim,&rdquo; the Cub leader said politely.
&ldquo;After all, the Cubs were a trifle hasty in their
actions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>The island owner waved aside the apology. &ldquo;This
is what I really came to say. I hope the Cubs will
forget that I ever ordered them away from the island.
I&rsquo;m engaging a new caretaker, and the property is
yours to use whenever you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s most generous of you, Mr. Manheim,&rdquo;
the Cub leader thanked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, I&rsquo;m deeding the camp site to the
Scouts without charge. It&rsquo;s the least I can do to
make amends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The island owner&rsquo;s generosity delighted the Cubs.
Dan proposed a cheer for Mr. Manheim which was
given with a will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing more,&rdquo; the island owner said. &ldquo;I understand
that Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s sailboat was struck either
by my motorboat or one which closely resembled
it. In either case, Jabowski was mixed up in the
affair. I&rsquo;ll send my check to cover the damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really isn&rsquo;t necessary,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to do it,&rdquo; Mr. Manheim insisted. &ldquo;Shall
we say it eases my conscience? Well, good-bye boys.
I&rsquo;ll see you at the new camp.&rdquo; With a friendly wave
of his hand, he departed.</p>
<p>The Cub meeting now ended quietly with the
singing of &ldquo;The Star Spangled Banner.&rdquo; After the
last note had died away, the boys clustered about
Jacques to grasp his hand and welcome him to the
organization.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very glad to be a Cub,&rdquo; the boy grinned. &ldquo;Glad
to be American too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think we aren&rsquo;t tickled to have you!&rdquo; Brad
said warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll have wonderful times next summer at
Skeleton Island,&rdquo; Dan added with an air of deep
satisfaction. He linked arms with Jacques and Brad
as the boys trooped out of the Cave. &ldquo;Best of all,
we&rsquo;ve proved to Mr. Manheim that Cubs really
know their stuff!&rdquo;</p>
